# QMOI/QCity Device Resource Optimization

## Overview
This guide details all techniques and features used by QCity/QMOI to optimize device resources, prevent slowdowns, and maximize performanceâ€”across all programming languages and environments.

## Real-Time Resource Monitoring
- Tracks CPU, memory, disk, and network usage in real time.
- Dashboard panel shows live stats and warnings if thresholds are exceeded.

## Resource-Aware Throttling & Auto-Offload
- Before running heavy tasks, QCity checks resource usage.
- If usage is high, tasks are throttled (delayed/lowered priority) or offloaded to cloud/Colab.
- User can override or adjust thresholds in settings.

## Process Isolation & Resource Limits
- Heavy commands run in isolated processes (child_process, subprocess, or containers).
- Uses OS tools (nice, cpulimit, taskset, Docker, etc.) to set CPU/memory limits.
- Ensures no single task can slow down or hang the device.

## Lightweight & Cloud-First Modes
- "Lightweight mode": Only UI/control runs locally; all heavy work is offloaded.
- "Cloud-first mode": Prefer cloud/Colab for all builds, installs, and tests.
- Easily switch modes in dashboard or config.

## Multi-Language & Environment Support
- QCity detects and manages environments for Node, Python, Java, Go, Rust, C/C++, and more.
- For each language:
  - Detects required tools (python, pip, venv, npm, yarn, maven, cargo, etc.).
  - Installs/updates dependencies atomically and in isolation.
  - Uses virtual environments/containers where possible.
  - Auto-installs missing runtimes or tools if needed.
- Self-heal scripts and backend support all major languages and package managers.

## Best Practices
- Keep resource thresholds conservative for best device performance.
- Use cloud-first mode for large projects or limited devices.
- Regularly monitor dashboard resource panel and adjust settings as needed.
