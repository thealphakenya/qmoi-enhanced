# QMOI Cross-Platform Cloning & Optimization (QMOICLONE)

## Overview
QMOI now supports fully automated, cross-platform cloning, deployment, error fixing, backup, and optimization for all supported platforms (Vercel, GitLab, GitHub, Colab, DagsHub, Gitpod, etc.).

## Features
- **Automated Cloning & Sync:**
  - Clones and syncs all configured repos from GitLab, GitHub, DagsHub, etc.
  - Keeps all directories in sync with local and cloud changes
- **Auto-Fix & Self-Healing:**
  - Detects and fixes errors in code, config, or deployment
  - Retries deploys and logs all actions
- **Cloud Optimization:**
  - Prefers free/ephemeral resources
  - Cleans up unused assets and optimizes for cost/performance
- **Backup & Auto-Evolution:**
  - Regularly backs up code, configs, and logs
  - Maintains changelog and evolves based on error/fix history
- **UI Integration:**
  - Master-only UI in QCity/QI for pipeline/log/resource control
  - Real-time status, logs, and manual/auto triggers

## Usage
- Run QMOI clone/optimize script:
  ```sh
  node scripts/qmoi-clone-optimize.cjs
  ```
- Or trigger via QCity/QI UI (master only)

## Extension Points
- Add new platforms or cloud targets
- Extend error-fixing and optimization logic
- Integrate with more UI panels or controls

## Troubleshooting
- All errors, fixes, and actions are logged in `qmoi-clone-optimize.log`
- Backups are stored in `qmoi-backups/`
- For issues, check logs and UI panels
- All cloning, mirroring, and backup operations are now handled exclusively by GitLab CI/CD automation.
- Email notifications are sent for all major events in GitLab/QMOI GitLab.
- The build and clone process now includes self-healing and notification logic: if a build fails, the system will attempt to auto-fix and notify all configured channels (Gmail, Slack, Telegram, Discord).

## Netlify Features
- Netlify clone, deploy, and optimization features are now included in this file. All Netlify-specific automation is handled as part of the main QMOI clone/optimize process.

## Universal Runner Engine
- Platform-aware runners auto-detect and load platform-specific modules (GitHub, GitLab, Hugging Face, etc.)
- Elastic, parallel, and self-healing: scale up/down, split jobs, auto-offload to cloud, auto-recover from errors
- AI/ML-driven optimization: runners analyze logs, performance, and errors across all platforms, auto-suggest/apply optimizations

## New Dashboard Widgets
- Platform Status Cards (top row): one per platform/clone, show status, runners, last sync, errors
- Universal Trigger Panel: select platform/job type, run any job (build, test, deploy, sync, backup, optimize)
- Elastic Scaling Panel: runner count per platform, scale up/down, resource usage bars
- Cross-Platform Job Matrix: jobs x platforms grid, status/logs/error/fix icons
- Clone Health & Sync Panel: sync status, last backup, error/fix history, Sync Now/Force Heal
- AI/ML Insights Panel: recommendations per platform, Apply/Ignore
- Evolution History Panel: timeline of auto-evolutions, improvements, rollbacks
- Master-Only Controls: advanced settings, manual override, audit logs (sidebar/floating)

## AI/ML Automation & Cross-Platform Learning
- AI/ML models aggregate logs/errors/fixes from all platforms
- Fixes/optimizations that work on one platform are auto-suggested/applied to others
- Runners self-evolve to support new platforms/features
- Auto-feature generation: AI proposes new features/scripts based on usage/errors/feedback
- All major changes require master approval

## Usage & Troubleshooting
- Use dashboard widgets to monitor status, trigger jobs, view logs, and apply AI/ML recommendations
- Master can trigger any job on any platform, scale runners, or force sync/heal
- All actions, fixes, and enhancements are logged and auditable
- For errors, use logs and AI/ML suggestions; master can override or roll back as needed

## Platform Independence & Cloned Infrastructure

- QMOI does not use the actual platforms (e.g., Gitpod, GitLab, GitHub, Vercel, etc.) for automation, CI/CD, or development.
- Instead, QMOI uses its own cloned, enhanced versions of these platforms, which are more advanced, secure, and optimized for QMOI's needs.
- All cloning, mirroring, and automation is handled by QMOI's own infrastructure, ensuring full independence and control.
- See INDEPENDENTQMOI.md for details on QMOI's independent operation and self-sustaining systems. 

## New Integrations & Enhancements

- **QMOIAUTOMAKENEW.md Integration:** QMOI Clone can now trigger autoclone/automake-new actions for any device, platform, or website from QCity, with master-only controls and audit logging.
- **QMOIBROWSER.md Integration:** QMOI Clone uses the QMOI Browser to autotest and fix all links and web features in every clone/sync cycle.
- **Always-On Cloud Operation:** QMOI Clone is always running in QCity/cloud/Colab/Dagshub, never relying on local device for critical tasks.
- **Enhanced QCity Runners & Devices:** All runners, devices, clones, and browsers are fully automated, parallelized, and offloaded to QCity/cloud for maximum reliability and speed.
- **Auto-Updating Documentation:** All .md files are auto-updated after every clone/sync cycle, ensuring documentation is always current.
- **Increased Minimum Daily Revenue:** QMOI Clone now targets a higher, dynamically increasing minimum daily revenue, using advanced strategies and statistics for all money-making features.
- **Enhanced Money-Making UI:** QCity dashboard now includes detailed statistics, charts, and controls for all QMOI money-making features, visible only to master/admin.
