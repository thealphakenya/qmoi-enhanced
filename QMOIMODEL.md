# QMOI Model Overview

QMOI (Quantum Multi-Objective Intelligence) is a self-healing, ever-evolving, cross-platform AI system. It is designed for robust automation, continuous improvement, and handsfree operation across all platforms, apps, and devices.


## Key Features
- Self-healing and auto-fixing (auto/manual)
- Continuous evolution and auto-development
- Real-time health, status, and performance monitoring
- Revenue generation, payment receipt, and financial transaction logging
- Tracks and track automation (all actions, errors, fixes, enhancements, and features are logged and referenced in TRACKS.md)

## [2025-10-10] Enhancement Log
- Persistent memory, multimodal chat (text, image, audio, file), modern chat UI, advanced avatar/voice settings, and stepwise documentation updates completed. All features are robust, user-friendly, and accessible for all ages. See TRACKS.md and DASHBOARDTRACKS.md for details.
- Credential management and memory sync (never forgets, always up-to-date)
- Handsfree operation and automation
- Multimodal API: text, image, JSON, streaming, function calling, embeddings
- Response quality: coherent, logical, context-aware, and accurate
- Speed: fast response and streaming support
- Reasoning: advanced context retention, tool use, and structured output



## Model Health, Status, and Self-Improvement
- Health checks and self-tests run continuously
- All endpoints and routes are monitored and tested
- Errors are auto-fixed or escalated for manual/human intervention
- All actions, errors, and fixes are logged in real time
- All multimodal API features are tested (see CURLCOMMANDS.md and qmoi_test.sh)
- Response quality, speed, and reasoning are benchmarked and logged
- **Automated Research & Autodevelopment:** QMOI can automatically run its test suite, analyze results, and use them to drive research, autodevelopment, and autoevolution features.
- **Self-Evolution:** Test results are used to trigger improvements, new feature development, and model evolutionâ€”fully handsfree.
- **Continuous Learning:** QMOI leverages all test and usage data to improve itself, correct errors, and optimize performance without human intervention.
