# QMOI Model Overview

QMOI (Quantum Multi-Objective Intelligence) is a self-healing, ever-evolving, cross-platform AI system. It is designed for robust automation, continuous improvement, and handsfree operation across all platforms, apps, and devices.


## Key Features
- Self-healing and auto-fixing (auto/manual)
- Continuous evolution and auto-development
- Real-time health, status, and performance monitoring
- Revenue generation, payment receipt, and financial transaction logging
- Tracks and track automation (all actions, errors, fixes, enhancements, and features are logged and referenced in TRACKS.md)
- Credential management and memory sync (never forgets, always up-to-date)
- Handsfree operation and automation
- Multimodal API: text, image, JSON, streaming, function calling, embeddings
- Response quality: coherent, logical, context-aware, and accurate
- Speed: fast response and streaming support
- Reasoning: advanced context retention, tool use, and structured output


## Model Health & Status
- Health checks and self-tests run continuously
- All endpoints and routes are monitored and tested
- Errors are auto-fixed or escalated for manual/human intervention
- All actions, errors, and fixes are logged in real time
- All multimodal API features are tested (see CURLCOMMANDS.md and qmoi_test.sh)
- Response quality, speed, and reasoning are benchmarked and logged
