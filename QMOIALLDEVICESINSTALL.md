# QMOI All Devices Install & Autotest Strategies

This document details all strategies, measures, and automated tests used to ensure QMOI apps install and run successfully on every supported device. It also describes how errors are auto-fixed and how apps remain lightweight and high-performance.

## Universal Installation Strategies
- Platform-specific build tools: Android Studio, Xcode, Electron, PyInstaller, etc.
- Automated packaging, signing, and verification for every binary.
- All binaries are optimized for minimal size and maximum performance.
- Installation instructions, dependencies, and system requirements are auto-generated and updated for every device.
- All download links are autotested and auto-fixed after every build.
- Self-healing CI/CD: .gitlab-ci.yml and all scripts are auto-linted, auto-fixed, and re-run on error.

## Device-Specific Measures & Autotests

### Android
- Universal APK/App Bundle, architecture checks, auto-update, voice control, offline mode.
- Autotest: Install APK on emulator/device, check for parsing errors, verify launch and permissions.
- Auto-fix: Rebuild APK, check manifest, re-sign if needed.

### Windows
- 64-bit .exe, digital signing, SmartScreen bypass, system tray, touchscreen, widgets.
- Autotest: Install .exe on VM/device, verify launch, check dependencies.
- Auto-fix: Rebuild with correct arch, re-sign, add missing dependencies.

### macOS
- .dmg/.app, code signing, Apple Silicon support, Spotlight/Siri integration.
- Autotest: Install .dmg/.app, verify launch, check for notarization issues.
- Auto-fix: Re-sign, rebuild for correct arch, update entitlements.

### Linux
- .AppImage/.deb/.rpm, execute permissions, CLI/daemon/cron, dependency auto-check.
- Autotest: Install/run on VM/device, check for missing dependencies, verify CLI/daemon.
- Auto-fix: Add missing dependencies, set permissions, rebuild package.

### iOS
- .ipa, TestFlight/App Store, Siri shortcuts, Face ID, push notifications.
- Autotest: Install .ipa via TestFlight, verify launch, check permissions.
- Auto-fix: Rebuild .ipa, update provisioning profile, fix entitlements.

### Chromebook
- APK/PWA/Linux app, Play Store/Web, Google Drive sync, offline mode, hybrid UI.
- Autotest: Install APK/PWA, verify launch, check sync/offline features.
- Auto-fix: Rebuild APK/PWA, update manifest, fix permissions.

### Raspberry Pi
- ARMv7/ARM64 .deb, GPIO/sensor integration, energy-efficient always-on node.
- Autotest: Install .deb, verify launch, check GPIO/sensor integration.
- Auto-fix: Rebuild for correct arch, add missing drivers.

### Smart TV
- TV APK/Web app, ADB/USB sideload, voice remote, dashboard, automation status.
- Autotest: Install APK/Web app, verify launch, check remote/dashboard features.
- Auto-fix: Rebuild APK, update manifest, fix permissions.

### QCity
- Web/Electron/VR app, real-time dashboard, smart nodes, orchestration, live tracking.
- Autotest: Launch app, verify dashboard, check orchestration features.
- Auto-fix: Rebuild app, update dependencies, fix integration issues.

## Download Link Autotest & Auto-Fix
- All download links are autotested after every build.
- Broken links are auto-fixed using fallback domains or re-upload.
- Verification reports are generated and included in documentation.

## Self-Healing CI/CD & Automation
- .gitlab-ci.yml and all automation scripts are auto-linted and auto-fixed on error.
- If any error is detected, the pipeline auto-corrects and re-runs the failed step.
- All installation autotests are run after every build; failures trigger auto-fix and re-test.

## Lightweight & High-Performance Apps
- All builds are optimized for minimal size using platform-specific compression and stripping tools.
- Performance autotests are run to ensure apps remain fast and responsive on all devices.

## Documentation & Support
- All .md files are auto-updated to reflect the latest installation, troubleshooting, and optimization logic for every platform and device.
- Summary tables and platform-specific guides are maintained and auto-updated for reference and support.
