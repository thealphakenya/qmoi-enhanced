# QMOI Gitpod Automation & UI (QMOICLONEGITPOD)

## Overview
QMOI can now fully automate and optimize development, deployment, and resource management in Gitpod, with:
- Automated cloning, syncing, and deployment of all required resources
- Full-featured UI panels in QCity and QI (visible only to master)
- Pipeline, logs, and resource control UI (mirroring Gitpod features)
- Ability to run independently (without Gitpod) but with all features
- Full access and control for QMOI master

## Features
- **Automated Gitpod Workspace Setup:**
  - Clones all required repos and resources on workspace start
  - Installs dependencies, sets up environment, and runs initial checks
  - Syncs with remote repos and cloud platforms (Vercel, Colab, DagsHub, etc.)
- **Self-Healing & Error Fixing:**
  - Detects and fixes all errors/issues in the workspace, pipeline, or deployment
  - Auto-redeploys and logs all actions
- **UI Features for QCity/QI (Master-Only):**
  - Master-only panels for pipeline/log/resource control
  - Real-time status, logs, and error/fix history
  - Manual and auto-trigger for redeploy, backup, and optimization
- **Independent Operation:**
  - Can run all features outside Gitpod (local, CI/CD, or other cloud IDEs)
  - Detects environment and adapts features accordingly
- **Full Access & Control:**
  - QMOI master can view, control, and audit all actions and resources
  - All actions are logged and backed up for permanent auto-evolution

## Usage
- On workspace start or push, QMOI will:
  1. Clone and sync all required repos/resources
  2. Set up environment and dependencies
  3. Run pipeline, fix errors, and redeploy as needed
  4. Show real-time status and logs in QCity/QI UI (master-only)
  5. Backup and optimize resources
- Manual run:
  ```sh
  node scripts/qmoi-clone-optimize.cjs
  # or trigger via QCity/QI UI (master only)
  ```

## Extension Points
- Add new UI panels or controls in QCity/QI (visible only to master)
- Integrate with more cloud IDEs or platforms
- Extend error-fixing and optimization logic for new environments

## Troubleshooting
- If a feature is missing in Gitpod, QMOI will adapt and run independently
- All errors, fixes, and actions are logged and can be reviewed in the UI or logs
