# ALLERRORTYPESANDHEALTHCHECKS.md

This document lists all error types, health check strategies, and autofix enhancements for QMOI, QCity, and QMOI Space. It is referenced for automation, self-healing, and permanent operation.

## Error Types
- Syntax errors (Python, JS, TS, HTML, CSS, YAML, etc.)
- Runtime errors
- API errors (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket)
- Network errors (timeout, unreachable, DNS, VPN)
- Database errors (connection, query, migration)
- Resource errors (memory, disk, CPU, cloud, server)
- Authentication/authorization errors
- UI/UX errors (render, input, accessibility)
- Integration errors (platform, service, device)
- Build/deployment errors (CI/CD, .yml, scripts)
- Security errors (vulnerabilities, access, secrets)
- Data errors (corruption, loss, format)
- Revenue/income errors (payment, sync, reporting)
- Unknown/edge-case errors

## Health Check Strategies
- Automated endpoint health checks (API, backend, frontend)
- Resource monitoring (memory, disk, CPU, cloud, server)
- Self-healing scripts for all platforms
- Continuous integration and deployment checks
- UI/UX validation and accessibility checks
- Security scanning and vulnerability patching
- Data integrity and backup checks
- Revenue and payment system monitoring

## Autofix Enhancements
- QMOI can auto-detect and fix all error types listed above
- Uses AI-powered scripts for syntax, runtime, and integration errors
- Monitors and repairs endpoints, workflows, and .yml files
- Auto-updates and patches all features, UI, and backend
- Self-healing and auto-recovery for all platforms and resources
- All fixes are logged and referenced for future automation
