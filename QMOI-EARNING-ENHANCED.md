# QMOI-EARNING-ENHANCED.md - Advanced QMOI AI Earning System

## Overview
The Enhanced QMOI AI Earning System is a comprehensive financial automation platform that integrates Mpesa, Airtel Money, WhatsApp Business, and automated verification systems. It operates 24/7 with master-only access controls and comprehensive audit logging. **The system is now optimized to generate a minimum of Ksh 50,000 per day and maintain at least Ksh 50,000 in QMOI Space. There is no maximum: QMOI always aims to generate more than the previous day.**

## Minimum Earning Targets & Growth
- **Daily Target**: Ksh 50,000 minimum per day (automated enforcement)
- **QMOI Space Minimum**: Ksh 50,000 must always be available in QMOI Space (auto-replenish if below)
- **No Maximum**: QMOI always tries to generate more than the previous day, with no upper limit
- **Automated Alerts**: Master is notified if targets are not met or balance drops below threshold
- **Runtime Enforcement**: See `scripts/qmoi-revenue-enforcer.js` for real-time enforcement, analytics, and growth logic

## Full Automation & AI Integration
- **Background Service**: Run `node scripts/qmoi-revenue-enforcer.js --auto` to enable continuous, background enforcement and analytics
- **Auto-Triggering**: If growth stalls or targets are missed, QMOI automatically triggers new project generation, marketing, and AI enhancements
- **Integration**: The enforcer script calls the auto-enhancement system to generate new high-revenue ideas, projects, and campaigns
- **Logging & Notification**: All actions, triggers, and results are logged and master is notified
