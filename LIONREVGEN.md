# Lion Revenue Generation Strategies

This document lists 25 concrete ways QMOI can use the Lion programming language to generate revenue. Each entry contains a short description and an implementation pattern.

1. Paid Lion course subscriptions — host premium coursebooks and charge subscriptions.
2. Enterprise automation contracts — build custom Lion plans for enterprises (SLA + support).
3. Marketplace for Lion libraries/adapters — sell connectors (payments, SMS, cloud).
4. App packaging service — compile Lion apps to native binaries (.lion wrapper) and charge per-build.
5. Managed hosting for Lion plans — provide execution-as-a-service for high-scale plans.
6. Templates and blueprints marketplace — sell prebuilt plans (backups, ETL, deploy pipelines).
7. Revenue share on monetized Lion apps — distribute apps and share revenue with creators.
8. Premium support and SLAs — enterprise support plans for mission-critical plans.
9. Automated lead-gen agents — use Lion to build scraping/automation flows that generate sales leads for clients.
10. Paid audits & security reviews — audit Lion plans for security and compliance.
11. Training and certification — paid exams and certifications for Lion proficiency.
12. Event-driven computing credits — charge usage hours for scheduled Lion plans.
13. Plugin/adapter licensing — license proprietary adapters (payment gateways, proprietary APIs).
14. Aggregated analytics & reporting — provide premium analytics from plan executions.
15. White-label deployments — deploy Lion-based solutions with custom branding for customers.
16. SaaS features unlocked by Lion scripts — advanced automation features behind paywall.
17. Affiliate integrations — Lion plans that integrate affiliate deals and share revenue.
18. Micro-payments inside Lion apps — enable in-app purchases using payment adapters.
19. Data transformation-as-a-service — charge for data pipelines written in Lion.
20. High-availability execution tiers — premium execution with retries and SLAs.
21. Marketplace for compiled Lion apps (.lion extension) — host and sell compiled apps.
22. Licensing for offline runtime (Den) — paid runtime licenses for offline/air-gapped deployments.
23. Sponsored coursebooks & certifications — brand-sponsored content distribution.
24. API monetization — expose Lion-executed endpoints as paid APIs.
25. Custom automation consulting — per-project engagement fee to build advanced Lion plans.

Each strategy should be implemented with clear product boundaries, sandbox/demo flows, and billing instrumentation (events, metering, invoices). Use mock adapters in dev and sandbox keys for testing.
