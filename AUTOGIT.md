# AUTOGIT.md

## AutoGit Overview

AutoGit is the AI-driven system for managing all code changes, commits, and pushes to GitHub.

### Features
- Detects and stages all changes
- Auto-commits with descriptive messages
- Pushes to main branch and handles merge conflicts
- Triggers error fixing and redeployment if needed
- Notifies master of all actions

### Error Handling
- If push fails, AI logs the error, attempts auto-fix, and retries
- All actions are logged in QMOISYSTEMAUTO.md
