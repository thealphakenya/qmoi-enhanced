# COMPONENTS.md
## Usage

Most components are used in the main application page (`app/page.tsx`) and are integrated into the sidebar, main content, or preview sections. Some are used in specialized panels, dashboards, or as context providers. For details, see the import statements and JSX usage in `app/page.tsx` and related files.

### Example Usage
```tsx
import { Chatbot } from '../src/components/Chatbot';
<Chatbot />
```

Props and usage details are documented in each component's file.

## Automation & Enhancement

- For production, ensure all components are styled, optimized, and tested for performance and reliability.
- Automation features include real-time logging, auto-sync, and persistent memory across all platforms and apps.
