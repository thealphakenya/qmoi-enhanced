Errors, fixes, and outcomes are logged for master review.
- **Error-Fix Sweep**: QMOI can run a full error-fix sweep across all assets and projects, automatically detecting and fixing issues in parallel.
- **High-Quality Site Generation & Audits**: QMOI now scaffolds all new sites using best-practice, modern templates (e.g., Next.js with TypeScript, ESLint, accessibility, and SEO features). Every site is automatically audited for accessibility, performance, SEO, and security, and QMOI will auto-enhance/fix issues before launch. Audit results and enhancements are logged for master review.

## Automation and Workflow Maintenance

- All GitHub Actions workflows and documentation (.md files) are now automatically updated by QMOI automation scripts. This includes real-time updates for new features, integrations, and best practices across the entire QMOI ecosystem.
