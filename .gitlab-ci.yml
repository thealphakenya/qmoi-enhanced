# [ENHANCEMENT] All jobs in this pipeline are executed in QMOI's cloned GitLab environment, never the actual GitLab. All heavy tasks (build, test, deploy, auto-fix, auto-evolution) are offloaded to Colab, Dagshub, or cloud runners for maximum performance and scalability. See QMOIAVATAR.md, QMOIAICORE.md, QMOIAUTOEVOLVE.md, README.md, CMDCOMMANDS.md, and all .md docs for details.

# [ENHANCEMENT] Ngrok tunnel health is checked and auto-fixed before any download/build/deploy. All download links are auto-updated to use ngrok URL if active and healthy. See QMOINGROK.md for details.

# [NOTE] All jobs are executed in QMOI's cloned, enhanced GitLab, never the actual GitLab. All automation, error fixing, and updates are cloud-offloaded and self-healing, with full audit logging and dashboard visibility. See all .md docs for cross-platform, notification, and dashboard details.
# [NOTE] Master-only manual override is available for any failed stage via dashboard or CLI.
# [NOTE] No billing issues - all operations use QMOI's self-hosted runners and cloud infrastructure.
# [NOTE] Enhanced health checks ensure all documented features are implemented and validated.
# [NOTE] Automated Git operations ensure repository is always up-to-date and synchronized.
# [NOTE] DNS health is checked and auto-fixed before any download/build/deploy. See QMOIDNS.md and ZERORATEDQMOI.md for details.
# [NOTE] If DNS cannot be fixed, QMOI auto-registers a free fallback domain via Freenom, updates all download links, and ensures downloads remain available. See QMOIDNS.md for full logic.
# [NOTE] QMOI QCity Automatic features include Freenom fallback domain creation, DNS automation, and link update. All logic is integrated and triggered automatically in the pipeline. See QMOIQCITYAUTOMATIC.md for full details.
# [NOTE] The pipeline now includes a job to verify all .md files are up to date, accurate, and all instructions/details are met. This job runs in real time, auto-updates all .md files for enhancements, evolution, and all features, and logs all actions. See QMOIQCITYAUTOMATIC.md and QCITYRUNNERSENGINE.md for details.
# [NOTE] Ngrok tunnel health is checked and links are auto-updated before any download/build/deploy. See QMOINGROK.md for details.
# [NOTE] NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN must be stored securely in the CI/CD environment, not in plaintext or code. See QMOINGROK.md for secure storage and usage best practices.
# [NOTE] autotest-download-links job ensures all download links in all .md files are autotested and auto-updated to the best working link (ngrok, fallback, etc.) before deploy. See QMOINGROK.md for details.
# [NOTE] ui-e2e-test, api-test, and md-link-check jobs ensure the UI, backend, and documentation are always autotested and working in every pipeline run.
# [NOTE] python-simple-autotest and node-simple-autotest jobs ensure QMOI system health and download links are always autotested and self-healing.
