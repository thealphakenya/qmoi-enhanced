# QMOI Sponsored Users

This file lists users that QMOI should treat as "sponsored" â€” they should not be charged for services and should receive master-level exemptions where appropriate.

Format: one username per line. The `qmoi_control_server.py` exposes endpoints to add/view sponsored users (`/sponsored/add`, `/sponsored/list`).

Master and immediate family (example):
- master
- sister

# How to modify
- Use the `POST /sponsored/add` endpoint as the master user or using the `QMOI_CONTROL_TOKEN`.
