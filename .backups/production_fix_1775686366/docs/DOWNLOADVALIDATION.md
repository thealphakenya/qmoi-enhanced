# Download Validation

Purpose

Define how downloads (build artifacts, installers, static assets) are validated before publishing or used by QMOI.

Measures and techniques

- Checksums: SHA256 for all artifacts; must match declared values in `qcity-artifacts/qmoi_build_report.json`.
- Timestamps: build timestamp must be recorded and compared with release tags.
- Signature verification: where available, verify detached signatures or package-level signatures.
- Virus/malware scan integration: CI should run a malware scanner on binary artifacts before publishing.
- Mirrors and CDN checks: verify that any mirror or CDN used serves the same checksum.

Operationalizing validation

- The orchestrator recomputes checksums and compares them to the build report.
- Any mismatch results in `docs/download_validation_report.json` with `mismatch` status and required remediation.
- LION can be configured to block deployments if critical artifacts fail validation.
