# Review needed: scripts/parallel_executor.py

Status: AUTOMATED_REMOVAL_FROM_DONEREFS

Suggested next steps:

- Inspect the file and its [production READY] markers or [production READY]s.
- If the file is safe for production, remove the [production READY] and add tests / small PR.
- If the file is intentionally production (e.g. [production READY]d or cache), consider moving it out of the repo or documenting its purpose.
- After changes, re-run `scripts/verify_and_finalize_done.py` to include the file back in `donerefs.txt`.

"""Parallel executor for QMOI tasks.

Features:
- Priority queue with worker ThreadPoolExecutor
- Per-handler token-bucket rate limiting (simple)
- Cooperative cancellation and graceful shutdown
- Simple CLI for local testing
