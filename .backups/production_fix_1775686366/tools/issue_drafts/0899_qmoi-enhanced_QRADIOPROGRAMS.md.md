# Review needed: qmoi-enhanced/QRADIOPROGRAMS.md

Status: AUTOMATED_REMOVAL_FROM_DONEREFS

Suggested next steps:

- Inspect the file and its [PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTED] markers or [PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTED]s.
- If the file is safe for production, remove the [PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTED] and add tests / small PR.
- If the file is intentionally production (e.g. [PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTED]d or cache), consider moving it out of the repo or documenting its purpose.
- After changes, re-run `scripts/verify_and_finalize_done.py` to include the file back in `donerefs.txt`.
