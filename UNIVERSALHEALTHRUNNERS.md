# QMOI Universal Health & Runners

## Overview
This file documents the universal health checks, runners, and automation flows for all QMOI apps, platforms, and devices. All health checks and runners are zero-rated (free, unlimited, no billing) and are managed by QMOI runners and QCity cloud.

## Health Checks
- All apps, downloads, builds, and tests are autotested for health and reliability.
- Device-specific error logs and health stats are referenced in `ALLERRORSSTATSQMOI.md`.
- Health checks are performed before and after every deployment, build, and download.
- All health issues are auto-fixed by QMOI runners and logged for audit.

## Runners
- QMOI runners are cloud-based, parallel, and self-healing.
- No paid runners or billing issues; all automation is zero-rated and unlimited.
- Runners handle autotesting, auto-fix, deployment, build, and download for every app and platform.
- All runner actions are logged and referenced in `QMOIGITPODDEV.md`, `QMOI-ENHANCED-README.md`, and `QMOI-ENHANCEMENT-SUMMARY.md`.

## Automation & Documentation

  - `QMOIFREE.md` (zero-rated features)
  - `DOWNLOADQMOIAIAPPALLDEVICES.md` (downloads)
