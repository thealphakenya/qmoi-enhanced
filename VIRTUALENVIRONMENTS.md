# Virtual Environments

QMOI supports creating language-specific virtual environments when running autodev. Supported tools:

- Python venv
- Node.js nvm/asdf
- Rust rustup

The autodev system will prefer safe creation in a project-local directory and will not overwrite user folders without consent.
