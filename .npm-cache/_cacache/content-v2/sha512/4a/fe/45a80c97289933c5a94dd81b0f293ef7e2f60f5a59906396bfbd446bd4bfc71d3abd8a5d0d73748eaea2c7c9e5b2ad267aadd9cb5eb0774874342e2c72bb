Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/overlookmotel/co-bluebird/master.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/overlookmotel/co-bluebird)\n\n## What it does\n\nIt's [co](https://www.npmjs.com/package/co), but using [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird) promises, rather than native V8 promises.\n\n#### Why?\n\nV8 promises at present have some features missing that [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird) has. In particular, bluebird's error handing and stack traces are better. And some people just prefer bluebird!\n\n## Usage\n\nExactly the same as [co](https://www.npmjs.com/package/co).\n\nAlso includes an extra `.use()` method, provided by [co-use](https://www.npmjs.com/package/co-use).\n\n## Tests\n\nUse `npm test` to run the tests. Use `npm run cover` to check coverage.\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee changelog.md\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you discover a bug, please raise an issue on Github. https://github.com/overlookmotel/co-bluebird/issues\n\n## Contribution\n\nPull requests are very welcome. Please:\n\n* ensure all tests pass before submitting PR\n* add an entry to changelog\n* add tests for new features\n* document new functionality/API additions in README\n","maintainers":[{"name":"overlookmotel","email":"theoverlookmotel@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2022-06-13T06:22:47.823Z","created":"2015-06-04T15:37:16.217Z","0.0.1":"2015-06-04T15:37:16.217Z","0.0.2":"2015-06-07T12:16:04.725Z","0.1.0":"2015-07-08T09:59:05.823Z","1.0.0":"2015-09-18T10:27:49.731Z","1.0.1":"2015-09-19T00:15:51.150Z","1.1.0":"2015-09-19T00:47:24.805Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/overlookmotel/co-bluebird","keywords":["co","use","bluebird","promise","promises","promisify","async","flow","generator","coro","coroutine"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/overlookmotel/co-bluebird.git"},"author":{"name":"Overlook Motel"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/overlookmotel/co-bluebird/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md"}
