You can avoid this by splitting the payload into smaller chunks.\n\n```js\nimport https from 'https';\nimport timer from '@szmarczak/http-timer';\n\nconst request = https.get('https://httpbin.org/anything');\ntimer(request);\n\nrequest.once('response', response => {\n\tresponse.resume();\n\tresponse.once('end', () => {\n\t\tconsole.log(response.timings); // You can use `request.timings` as well\n\t});\n});\n\n// {\n//   start: 1572712180361,\n//   socket: 1572712180362,\n//   lookup: 1572712180415,\n//   connect: 1572712180571,\n//   upload:

the milliseconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch.\n\n- `start` - Time when the request started.\n- `socket` - Time when a socket was assigned to the request.\n- `lookup` - Time when the DNS lookup finished.\n- `connect` - Time when the socket successfully connected.\n- `secureConnect` - Time when the socket securely connected.\n- `upload` - Time when the request finished uploading.\n- `response` - Time when the request fired `response` event.\n- `end` - Time when the response fired `end` event.\n- `error` - Time when the request fired `error` event.\n- `abort` - Time when the request fired `abort` event.\n- `phases`\n\t- `wait` - `timings.socket - timings.start`\n\t- `dns` - `timings.lookup - timings.socket`\n\t- `tcp` - `timings.connect - timings.lookup`\n\t- `tls` -
