# Shell / POSIX Environment

QMOI includes many shell scripts. Recommended setup:

- Use bash 5+ for scripts that rely on newer features.
- Ensure standard tools are present: curl, wget, tar, unzip, git, grep, sed, awk.
- For reproducible operations, prefer running scripts in a container (Docker) or a devcontainer.
