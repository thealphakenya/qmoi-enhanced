- **Extensible:** New memory modules and features can be added without downtime.

### Technical Details
- **Storage:** Uses a combination of local database (IndexedDB/SQLite), encrypted cloud storage, and versioned backups.
- **Indexing:** Fast search and retrieval using full-text and semantic indexing.
