## QMOI Memory System - Enhanced Permanent, High-Speed, Parallel Memory

QMOI's memory system is now fully automated, permanent, and capable of remembering and recalling vast amounts of information at extremely high speed. The system is designed for advanced reasoning, learning, and parallel processing, ensuring QMOI can learn, adapt, and reason in real time across all features and platforms.

### Core Features
- **Permanent Memory:** All memories, events, and knowledge are stored permanently and never lost, with full backup and redundancy.
- **High-Speed Recall:** QMOI can instantly recall any memory, fact, or event, regardless of size or complexity.
- **Massive Capacity:** QMOI can remember and process millions of facts, events, and user interactions in parallel.
- **Parallel Memory Engine:** All memory operations (read, write, update, recall) are parallelized for maximum speed and reliability (see QMOIALWAYSPARALLEL.md).
- **Advanced Reasoning:** QMOI uses its memory to reason, infer, and make decisions in real time, supporting advanced learning and adaptation.
- **Continuous Learning:** QMOI learns from every interaction, event, and system change, updating its memory and knowledge base automatically.
- **Contextual Memory:** QMOI can recall context, user preferences, and historical data for personalized responses and actions.
- **Self-Healing & Redundancy:** All memory is backed up and self-healing, with automatic recovery from any failure.
- **Master-Only Controls:** Master can view, search, edit, and manage all memory from the QCity dashboard, with advanced visualization and audit logs.
- **Memory Visualization UI:** QCity dashboard includes a memory visualization panel, search, timeline, and advanced filters for all memory types (facts, events, user data, logs, etc.).
- **Reasoning & Learning UI:** Master can view and control reasoning and learning processes, trigger deep learning cycles, and review reasoning chains.

### API & Integration
- `/api/qmoi/memory` for all memory operations (read, write, search, update, delete, visualize, backup, restore).
- Integrated with QMOIALWAYSPARALLEL.md for parallel memory operations and real-time learning.
- All memory actions are logged and auditable.

### Advanced Reasoning & Learning
- **Reasoning Engine:** QMOI uses its memory to perform multi-step reasoning, hypothesis generation, and decision making.
- **Learning Engine:** QMOI continuously learns from new data, user feedback, and system events, updating its memory and improving performance.
- **Parallel Reasoning:** Multiple reasoning and learning tasks run in parallel, with real-time status and results in the dashboard.
- **Master Controls:** Master can trigger, pause, or review reasoning and learning cycles, and view detailed logs and outcomes.

## Advanced Security & Privacy Integration
- **Anti-Tracking & Anti-Hacking:** QMOI Memory now includes advanced anti-tracking, anti-hacking, and privacy features, and is fully integrated with QMOI VPN, QMOI Masks, and security systems. All memory is protected, monitored, and self-healing.
