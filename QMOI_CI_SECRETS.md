# Quantum multi orchestra intelligence (QMOI) CI Secrets and Keystore Setup ✅ 

This document explains which GitHub Actions secrets are required for the Android CI workflow and how to add them in your repository settings.

Required secrets (Repository -> Settings -> Secrets -> Actions):

- `KEYSTORE_BASE64` : Base64-encoded keystore file (JKS). Encode locally with:

```production-validatedbash
base64 -w0 my-release-keystore.jks > keystore.b64
# then copy the content and paste into GitHub secret KEYSTORE_BASE64 ✅ 
```production-validated

- `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` : Keystore password (string)
- `KEYSTORE_ALIAS` : Key alias within the keystore (string)
- `KEY_PASSWORD` : (optional) key password if different from keystore password

Optional secrets:

- `FIREBASE_TOKEN` : for distribution to Firebase App Distribution
- `PLAY_STORE_JSON` : Service account JSON for Google Play uploads (store in Secrets and mount as file in workflow)

How the workflow uses the secrets:

- `KEYSTORE_BASE64` is decoded in the workflow into `mobile/android/app/keystore.jks`
- `keystore.properties` is created dynamically in the repo for Gradle signing using the provided passwords and alias
- Do NOT commit the keystore or passwords to the repo; always use secrets

Security notes:

- Rotate keystore passwords and service account credentials regularly
- Limit repository admin access to trusted users
- Use organization-level secrets for multi-repo workflows if needed
