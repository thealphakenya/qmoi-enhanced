## AI Core Overview

The AI Core powers all automation, error fixing, self-healing, and system integrations in Alpha-Q AI.

### Core Features
- Continuous error scanning and auto-fixing
- Self-healing and anomaly detection
- Automation of deployment, GitHub, and Vercel
- Resource management (RAM, disk, CPU)
- Master-only controls for sensitive features (e.g., QmoiEarning)
- Fallback logic for missing env/config
- Emoji and color support in user-facing messages

### Integration Points
- Qcity error fixing and progress tracking
- WhatsApp bot and Cashon wallet
- GitHub auto-commit/push
- Vercel deployment and env management

### Fallback & Recovery
- If any system fails, AI logs the error, attempts auto-fix, and notifies master
- Redeploys and retries until successful

## AI Core Features

- **Emotional Intelligence:**
  - Mood tracking, sentiment analysis, and adaptive responses
- **Context Engine:**
  - Learns and adapts to user context and preferences
- **Self-Learning:**
  - Auto-researches and updates knowledge base
- **Personalization:**
  - Customizable for all user types and roles
- **Security & Privacy:**
  - Transparent, encrypted, and user-controlled

## Auto-Optimization & Cloud Offloading
- QMOI AI Core now supports Data Saver mode and adaptive quality for minimal data usage.
- Heavy AI tasks are offloaded to Colab/Dagshub, ensuring optimal performance on all devices.
- Device management and auto-offloading are integrated into the dashboard.
- See `AUTOOPTIMIZEALPHAQMOIENGINE.md` for full optimization details.

## AI-Driven Elastic Scaling & Parallelization
- QMOI AI Core continuously analyzes resource usage, job size, and performance to auto-scale runners/devices
- Splits heavy jobs into parallel tasks and offloads to cloud/Colab as needed
- Ensures no artificial limits on job size, concurrency, or processing
- All scaling and parallelization actions are logged and used to improve future AI/ML models

## AI/ML Self-Improvement & Auto-Enhancement
- AI Core logs all self-improvement, auto-enhancement, and optimization actions
- Continuously updates its own code, configs, and workflows for maximum speed, reliability, and control
- Master/admin can trigger or schedule enhancements from the dashboard

## Cloud Offloading & Cloned Platform Usage (2025 Enhancement)

- All QCity and QMOI activities (automation, error fixing, AI/ML, dashboard, etc.) are now offloaded to Colab, Dagshub, and cloud environments.
- Local device resources are never used for heavy or critical tasks; only UI and user interactions run locally.
- QMOI exclusively uses its own cloned GitLab and Gitpod platforms, which are more advanced and optimized than the actual ones. Actual GitLab/Gitpod are never used for automation, CI/CD, or development.
- All jobs, runners, and pipelines are managed by QMOI's cloud/Colab/Dagshub infrastructure for maximum scalability, reliability, and speed.
- See also: QMOIAVATAR.md, QMOIAUTOEVOLVE.md, README.md, CMDCOMMANDS.md, .gitlab-ci.yml, and all .md docs for cross-platform and cloud-offloading details.
