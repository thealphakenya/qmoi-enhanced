# QMOI Model Card

Model Name: Qmoi
Version: v0.0.0 (update after evaluations)

## Overview

Qmoi is a multimodal, instruction-tuned generative model designed for reasoning, retrieval, and safe interaction. It supports text, code, and optional multimodal extensions.

## Intended Use

- Conversational assistant, research aide, code helper, and content generation.
- Deployable on local servers, cloud, edge devices, and inside Qvillage model hub.

## Limitations

- May produce incorrect or biased content.
- Relies on retrieval index freshness for factuality.
- Performance depends on hardware and quantization choices.

## Architecture

- Transformer-decoder backbone with optional MoE routing and LoRA adapters.
- Supports KV cache for streaming and long contexts.
- Quantized runtime (INT8/INT4) options for edge.

## Training Data

- Curated multi-domain corpora (text, code, scientific) and supervised instruction datasets.

## Evaluation Metrics

- Latency p50/p95, MMLU, GSM8K, HumanEval, Safety flag-rate.

## Safety & Governance

- Safety classifiers, PII protection, red-team testing, differential-privacy options.
- Governance board approves model promotions.

## Model Card Autoupdate (Autodev Integration)

The autodev pipeline will update this model card automatically after successful builds and validations.
Implementation notes:

- After each build, autodev will generate metadata: version, commit hash, evaluation results, benchmarks, changelog.
- Autodev stores artifacts in `qvillage/registry/<model-name>/<version>/` and writes a JSON metadata file.
- A small script (`tools/update_model_card.py`) reads the metadata and rewrites sections of this file (e.g., Version, Evaluation Metrics, Changelog).

## Offline & Always-On Deployment

- Qmoi supports local inference and is packaged as a container for easy deployment.
- For always-on usage, run the container in a supervisor (systemd, docker-compose, or k8s) with auto-restart and resource monitors.
- When offline, Qmoi uses local vector DB and cached artifacts.

## Resource Guidance

- GPU: prefer A100/V100/RTX 30-series for large models. Use quantized builds for lower-cost GPUs.
- CPU: quantized runtime available for inference on CPUs (int8 path).
- Memory: aim to keep total model + KV usage < 85% of device memory; use swap/backing store for large models.

## Governance & Contact

- Maintainers: TBD
- Governance: Qvillage Governance Board
