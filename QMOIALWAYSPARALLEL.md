# QMOIALWAYSPARALLEL.md - QMOI Parallel Engine

## 🚀 Parallel Error Fixing & Automation
- QMOI uses its parallel engine to fix errors, install missing files/packages, and run automations across all platforms (GitLab, Vercel, Hugging Face, Colab, Dagshub, GitHub, Quantum) at the same time.
- Multiple fixes, installs, and deployments can run in parallel, maximizing speed, uptime, and reliability.
- QMOI auto-detects and fixes errors, even those requiring developer/manual intervention, and can create/fix scripts as needed.
- All parallel actions are visualized in the dashboard, with real-time status, logs, and notifications.
- Master receives notifications for every parallel job (start, progress, completion, failure), with full audit logs.
- All parallelization and automation is now handled exclusively by GitLab CI/CD.

## 👨‍💻 Developer/Manual-Level Fixes
- QMOI simulates a real developer: it can reason about complex errors, apply manual fixes, and write new scripts/code as needed.
- QMOI reviews logs, suggests improvements, and documents all changes for audit and learning.
- Master can review, approve, or override any automated or manual fix from the dashboard.

## 📦 Automated Installation & Self-Healing
- QMOI auto-installs all missing dependencies, files, and packages, and verifies their integrity.
- If a required script or file is missing or broken, QMOI auto-creates or fixes it.
- All install/self-healing actions are visualized and notified in real time.

## 📧 Enhanced Notifications
- Master is notified by email (and other channels) for every parallel job, fix, install, or deployment (start, progress, completion, failure).
- Notifications are configurable and can be filtered by event type, platform, or severity.

## 📚 Documentation
- All documentation (.md files) is always kept up to date and indexed in ALLMDFILESREFS.md.
