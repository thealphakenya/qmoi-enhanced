⚡ How to use

Save the script as git-smart-sync.ps1 in your repo root (or somewhere in PATH).

In PowerShell, allow scripts to run (only once if not already enabled):

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned


Run it inside your repo:

.\git-smart-sync.ps1


Or specify a different branch:

.\git-smart-sync.ps1 -Branch develop


✅ This script guarantees:

No dangling rebases.

Local changes never lost.

Always synced with remote.

Always pushes clean history.
