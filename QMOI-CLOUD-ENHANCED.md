# QMOI Enhanced Cloud Features

## Overview
QMOI Enhanced Cloud System now provides fully automated, self-healing, and ultra-lightweight operation for all environmentsâ€”including mobile. All builds, tests, and error-fixing (including for mobile apps) can be offloaded to the cloud, with master-only access to error/fix logs and controls. The system continuously updates itself, auto-fixes errors, and ensures minimal device resource usage.

## ðŸš€ Enhanced Cloud Features

### 1. Multi-Cloud Integration
- **AWS, GCP, Azure, Cloudflare, DigitalOcean**: All supported for compute, storage, and offloading.
- **Mobile Cloud Builds**: Mobile app builds/tests are offloaded to the cloud when local resources are low or on-demand.
- **Continuous Self-Healing**: All errors (including in mobile, cloud, and CI/CD) are auto-fixed in the cloud, with master-only access to error/fix logs and controls.
- **Automated Last-Updated Dates**: Documentation and system UIs always show the real last update date.

### 2. Intelligent Resource Offloading
- **Mobile Automation**: Use `node scripts/qmoi-mobile-auto-selfheal.js` to ensure mobile is always running, self-healing, and offloading to the cloud as needed.
- **Ultra-Lightweight Operation**: All heavy tasks are offloaded to the cloud, keeping local device usage minimal.
- **Self-Updating Agent**: QMOI continuously pulls from GitHub, applies PRs, and updates all environments.

### 3. Master-Only Error/Fix UI
- **Master-Only Logs**: All error/fix logs and controls are visible only to master users in all UIs (mobile, browser, dashboard).

### 4. Automated Documentation Updates
- **Last-Updated Dates**: All documentation and UIs show the real last update date, updated automatically by the system.

## Automation Autotest

A new autotest script is available to verify that all QMOI automation scripts run successfully:

```sh
npm run qmoi:automation:autotest
```

- This will run all automation scripts in sequence and report any errors.
- If you see a missing script error, ensure you are running from the project root, not a subdirectory.

## How to Use
- Configure cloud options in `config/qcity-device-config.json` and `config/qmoi_cloud_config.json`.
- Use dashboard to monitor cloud status, trigger offloading/sync, and view master-only error/fix logs.
- Use `node scripts/qmoi-mobile-auto-selfheal.js` for mobile automation and self-healing.
