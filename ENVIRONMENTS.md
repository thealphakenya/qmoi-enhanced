# QMOI Environments Reference

This file lists runtime environments QMOI supports and how QMOI autodevelops and autoevolves them.

Included environments:
- Python - see `PYTHONENVIRONMENT.md`
- TypeScript / JavaScript - see `TYPESCRIPTENVIRONMENT.md`
- Shell / POSIX - see `SHELLENVIRONMENT.md`
- Rust - see `RUST.md`
- Virtual Environments - see `VIRTUALENVIRONMENTS.md`
- Docker Containers - see `DOCKERCONTAINERS.md`
- Cloud Environments - see `CLOUDENVIRONMENTS.md`
- Den (Lion runtime) - see `DEN.md`
- Local Environments - see `LOCALENVIRONMENTS.md`
- CI/CD Environments - see `CI_CDENVIRONMENTS.md`

QMOI will maintain and auto-update these environment docs and will attempt to create or fix the required environment automatically when attempting self-heal or autodev operations.
