# Lion Language (Draft)

Lion is a lightweight domain-specific language (DSL) concept used by QMOI for expressing high-level automation plans, transforms, and healing rules.

This repository contains a draft specification and examples. Lion is currently a documentation-first project: the runtime and compiler are TODOs.

See `LIONCODINGLANGUAGE.md` for the spec skeleton and `LIONRELEASES.md` for release notes.
