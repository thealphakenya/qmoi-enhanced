Certainly! Below is the fully upgraded architecture and roadmap for your AI trading application Alpha-Q, featuring your custom models Qmoi, a master-only permission system, and smart wallet integration through Pesapal (Cashon), with full Airtel Money/M-Pesa automation.

This version is designed for real-world micro-trading (as low as KES 10) and built for continuous profit scaling, full AI autonomy, and future-ready AI expansion.

🔐 MASTER-ONLY ACCESS FRAMEWORK

Feature	Access

View balances, trades	Master-only
Authorize funding (M-Pesa/Airtel)	Master (biometric/passphrase)
Withdraw funds	Master-only
Control Qmoi models	Master-only

Behavior:

Detects low balance → triggers STK Push deposit

Separates locked profit from active capital

Reinvests based on ROI confidence

Keeps transaction logs for auditing


if cashon.balance < qmoi.min_trade_amount():
    pesapal.initiate_deposit(50)  # KES
else:
    qmoi.trade(amount=cashon.calculate_dynamic_size())

---

📊 5. Trade Monitoring + CLI Dashboard (Optional)

Features:

Trade alerts (Telegram, Discord, CLI terminal)


Example:

> alphaq status
🧠 QMOI: Strategy = Trend Follow
📈 Last ROI: +4.8%
💰 Wallet: KES 1,780.00
🔒 Locked Profits: KES 560.00


---

🔄 Automated Trade Lifecycle

[Loop Start Every 5 Min]
→ Check Cashon balance
→ If balance < KES 10 → Auto-deposit (w/ Master permission)
→ Else:
    → Qmoi runs analysis
    → Predicts best asset & size
    → Executes order via selected exchange
    → Updates logs, wallet, strategy state
→ Repeat


---

💸 Profit Control Logic

Locks a % of profits into non-tradable pool

Withdrawable on master command

Optionally auto-stake idle funds (see enhancements)

Avoids overexposure by checking volatility

🧭 NEXT STEP OPTIONS

Would you like to begin by:

1. Building the Cashon wallet and Pesapal layer?


2. Deploying Qmoi's AI model and trade executor?


3. Creating a terminal CLI interface for master monitoring?


4. Starting on future enhancements (like yield or arbitrage)?



I can now provide detailed code structure, API design, and logic flow for any module you'd like to start with. Just tell me what you want to build first.
