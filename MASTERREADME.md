## QMOI Enhanced Controller: Automated Account & Financial Verification (June 2025)

- The QMOI Enhanced Controller (`scripts/qmoi-enhanced-controller.py`) now automates all account and financial verifications on startup.
- Supports two modes:
  - **Oneshot:** `python scripts/qmoi-enhanced-controller.py` — runs all verifications and enhancements once.
  - **Daemon:** `python scripts/qmoi-enhanced-controller.py daemon` — runs all verifications on startup and then every hour (configurable).
- Every verification, connection, and transaction triggers an instant WhatsApp notification to the master.
- All actions are logged for audit and compliance.
- This ensures the master is always informed and in control of all sensitive operations.
