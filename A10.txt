AI wrote your code. Open source rejected it. Here's why.
00:00 | 15:40
The landscape has changed for AI development.
Last year, the main concern around AI coding assistants was accuracy, now it's trust.

Open‑source projects are increasingly cautious about accepting AI-generated code, while new fees on data scraping are pushing teams to reconsider how they build AI workflows. Here’s how your team can adapt, keeping velocity high without compromising security or compliance.

TL;DR

•	ICYMI → Ona early access: Privacy-first software engineering agents that run entirely inside your VPC. Rolling out to first users – Request early access.
•	Code provenance becomes critical. QEMU banned AI-generated commits; traceable, auditable code is now table stakes.
•	Web scraping gets expensive. Cloudflare meters AI crawlers; keep agents internal or pay per request.
•	Memory makes agents reliable. MIT research shows structured memory boosts agent performance by 30%.

Ecosystem watch
QEMU bans AI-generated code
Open-source maintainers at QEMU have started rejecting patches generated by tools like Copilot and ChatGPT, citing unclear code provenance and licensing concerns. Expect more projects to follow suit, making signed commits and clear authorship essential.

Cloudflare introduces pay-per-crawl for AI bots
Cloudflare now charges for web scraping by AI agents, turning a once-free resource into a metered service. Keeping agents inside your infrastructure and using local data reduces compliance risk and cost.

Context beats prompts for agent performance
LangChain outlines four practical steps—write, select, compress, isolate—to shrink token counts, reduce costs, and improve the reliability of agent-generated code. Clearer context equals safer results.

Memory transforms agent reliability
MIT researchers have shown that agents with structured memory outperform stateless ones by 30%. By maintaining state and tracking progress, these agents handle complex tasks better and recover gracefully from failures. The takeaway: agents work best when their context and memory are structured, sandboxed, and auditable.

Developers are becoming orchestrators
As AI agents handle more coding tasks, developers find themselves managing code rather than writing it. Understanding and embracing this shift can help developers stay effective—and satisfied—in an AI-driven workflow. (P.S. we had similar thoughts a few weeks ago).

ICYMI: Launches & new stories
Watch Ona close your GitHub issues
See Ona autonomously pick up a GitHub issue, break it into subtasks, implement unit tests, and push updates, all while you focus on other work. From automated dev container configuration to complete test implementation with real-time GitHub status updates, watch how enterprise teams can multiply their engineering output without compromising security.

Real-world use cases for secure AI agents
Here are 42 use cases from workshops we held in London and NYC with 100+ platform engineers to either inspire you—or deter you—in shaping your own AI roadmap.

The enterprise version of Codex just dropped (but it's not from OpenAI)
Love coding with Codex on weekends but can't use it at work? Ona brings the same parallel execution and background processing to enterprise development—except it runs in your VPC with your choice of models. Jump between AI orchestration and hands-on coding in your preferred editor, while your security team stays happy.

Ona: Your privacy-first software engineering agent
Ona runs entirely within your VPC; your code, credentials, and logs never leave your infrastructure. Each task creates an isolated, disposable workspace and returns small, tested code changes. Gitpod enterprise customers get priority access.

Gitpod-hosted compute launches this summer
Fully-managed SaaS option with high-performance CPUs and GPUs. Get standardized development environments that start in seconds with zero infrastructure setup. Join the waitlist.

Gitpod improvements for better security and efficiency
We've shipped three updates to strengthen your development workflows:

VPC endpoints for secure internal network traffic.
Organization-level secrets to simplify credential management.
