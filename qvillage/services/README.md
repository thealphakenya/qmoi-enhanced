# QVillage Services (placeholder)

Add implementation stubs here for:
- model-hub (upload/download models)
- model-deploy (serve models via REST/gRPC)
- billing and quotas (ensure free tier for QMOI)
- dataset management
- model card and metadata features

This folder is intentionally a scaffold. Implementations should be safe, well-tested and documented in `qvillage/integration.md`.
