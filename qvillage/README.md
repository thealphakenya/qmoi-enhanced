# QVillage (scaffold)

QVillage is the project's model & model-hosting platform (an internal 'huggingface-like' hub).
This folder contains a lightweight scaffold and a feature-checklist generator that parses `HUGGINGFACEPAYED.md` and produces a checklist of features to implement.

This scaffold is intentionally non-destructive and aims to help track and implement features locally before full production integrations.
