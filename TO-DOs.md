# TO-DOs for making QMOI production-ready

This file lists prioritized tasks, each with a status tag and timestamp. The tasks are intended to be machine-readable for auto-updating by QMOI agents.

- [ ] [2025-10-20T00:00:00Z] Validate linting across all languages  #status:todo
- [ ] [2025-10-20T00:00:00Z] Run full unit/integration test suite  #status:todo
- [ ] [2025-10-20T00:00:00Z] Validate orchestrator deployment scripts  #status:todo

(QMOI agent can update the status tags to #status:done or #status:failed with timestamps when checks run.)
