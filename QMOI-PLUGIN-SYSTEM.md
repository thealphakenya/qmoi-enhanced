# QMOI Plugin System

## Overview
The QMOI Plugin System allows third-party and internal plugins to extend QMOI's capabilities, including UI enhancements, device management, optimization, and AI review features.

---

## 1. Plugin Types
- **UI Plugins:** Add new panels, tabs, or widgets to the dashboard.
- **Device/Optimization Plugins:** Enhance device management, health checks, and optimization logic.
- **Review/Analysis Plugins:** Provide AI-powered review, suggestions, or analysis for projects, devices, or workflows.

## 2. Plugin API
- **Registration:** Plugins register with the QMOI Plugin Manager at runtime.
- **Lifecycle:** Plugins have `init`, `activate`, `deactivate`, and `destroy` hooks.
- **Integration Points:**
  - Dashboard UI (tabs, panels, notifications)
  - Device management (health, optimization, offloading)
  - AI review and automation workflows
- **Settings:** Plugins can expose settings in the dashboard for user configuration.

## 3. Loading & Management
- Plugins are loaded dynamically at startup or on demand.
- Users can enable/disable plugins from the dashboard.
- Plugin status and logs are visible in the Plugins section.

## 4. Example Plugin Structure
```ts
export interface QmoiPlugin {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  init(): void;
  activate(): void;
  deactivate(): void;
  destroy(): void;
  getSettingsPanel?(): React.ReactNode;
}
```

## 5. Example Plugins
- **Device Health Reviewer:** Analyzes device stats and suggests optimizations.
- **Optimization Suggestion Plugin:** Recommends Data Saver or offloading actions.
- **UI Widget Plugin:** Adds a floating panel with real-time AI insights.

## 6. Extending QMOI
- Plugins can extend any part of QMOI, including device management, optimization, review, and automation.
- All plugins are sandboxed for security and stability.

## Example: Device Health Reviewer Plugin

```ts
import React from "react";
import { QmoiPlugin } from "./PluginManager";

export const DeviceHealthReviewerPlugin: QmoiPlugin = {
  id: "device-health-reviewer",
  name: "Device Health Reviewer",
  description: "Analyzes device stats and suggests optimizations.",
  init() {},
  activate() {},
  deactivate() {},
  destroy() {},
  getSettingsPanel() {
    // Mock stats for demonstration
    const stats = {
      cpu: 72.5,
      memory: 68.2,
      disk: 81.3,
      network: 55.0,
    };
    const suggestions = [
      stats.cpu > 70 ? "Consider offloading tasks to Colab/Dagshub." : null,
      stats.memory > 65 ? "Enable Data Saver mode to reduce memory usage." : null,
      stats.disk > 80 ? "Clean up unused files or increase storage quota." : null,
      stats.network > 50 ? "Monitor network usage for large syncs." : null,
    ].filter(Boolean);
    return (
      <div>
        <h4>Device Health</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>CPU Usage: {stats.cpu}%</li>
          <li>Memory Usage: {stats.memory}%</li>
          <li>Disk Usage: {stats.disk}%</li>
          <li>Network Usage: {stats.network}%</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Suggestions</h5>
        <ul>
          {suggestions.length ? suggestions.map((s, i) => <li key={i}>{s}</li>) : <li>No issues detected.</li>}
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  },
};
```

### Usage

Register the plugin in your dashboard code:

```ts
import { PluginManager } from "./PluginManager";
import { DeviceHealthReviewerPlugin } from "./DeviceHealthReviewerPlugin";

const pluginManager = new PluginManager();
pluginManager.register(DeviceHealthReviewerPlugin);
```

The plugin will now appear in the Plugins tab of the dashboard, showing device health and suggestions.
