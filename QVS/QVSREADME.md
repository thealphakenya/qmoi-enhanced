# QVS (QMOI Virtual System) Enhancements

## Overview
This module introduces the QMOI Kernel as a modular, persistent, and autonomous core for Alpha-Q. It provides:
- Smart deployment, replication, autonomous tasks, triggers, persistence, adaptation, and logging
- Full integration with the QMOI system and UI panels for master/admin users in QCity and QI
- API endpoints for status and payload control
- Compliance checks and enhanced automation for workflows

## Features
- **QMOI Kernel**: Modular Python backend for all core system tasks
- **UI Integration**: Master-only panels in QCity and QI for monitoring and control
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/qmoi/status` and `/api/qmoi/payload` for frontend-backend communication
- **Compliance**: Early and automated compliance checks, integrated with CI/CD
- **Auto-Evolve**: QMOI can adapt, replicate, and optimize itself and connected systems

## Usage
- Master/admin users can access the QMOI Kernel Panel in QCity/QI dashboards
- Use the panel to monitor status, view logs, and trigger QMOI payloads
- All actions are logged and auditable

## Compliance & Automation
- Compliance checks run before deployment and in CI/CD workflows
- All changes are tested and validated for security, reliability, and compliance
