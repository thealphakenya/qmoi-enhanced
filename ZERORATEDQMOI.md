## QMOI Zero-Rated Internet System

### Overview
QMOI Zero-Rated is a global, always-on internet fallback system that leverages zero-rated (free data) sites and services to ensure QMOI and QCity devices are always connected, regardless of location or network restrictions.

---

## 1. What is Zero-Rated QMOI?
- **Zero-Rated Sites:** Websites/services that are accessible without data charges (e.g., Wikipedia, Facebook Free Basics, WhatsApp, Google, select educational/government sites).
- **QMOI Zero-Rated Proxy:** QMOI can set up and manage a lightweight proxy/tunnel that routes essential traffic through zero-rated endpoints.
- **Global Fallback:** If all other connections fail, QMOI automatically switches to zero-rated mode to maintain connectivity.

---

## 2. How QMOI Sets Up and Uses Zero-Rated Internet
- **Auto-Detection:** QMOI continuously monitors connectivity and detects when only zero-rated access is available.
- **Proxy/Tunnel Setup:** QMOI can deploy a minimal web proxy or tunnel (e.g., using a cloud function, serverless, or a lightweight VPS) that mimics zero-rated traffic.
- **Dynamic Switching:** QMOI switches to zero-rated mode automatically and routes essential traffic (API, heartbeat, commands) through the proxy.
- **Global Coverage:** QMOI maintains a list of zero-rated endpoints for every region and can spin up new ones as needed.
- **Fallback Logic:** If a zero-rated site is blocked, QMOI tries the next available one, or sets up a new endpoint.

## 3. Technical Implementation
- **Zero-Rated Site List:** Maintained and updated regularly (Wikipedia, Facebook, WhatsApp, Google, YouTube, etc.).
- **Proxy Deployment:** QMOI can deploy a proxy on demand (e.g., using Heroku, Vercel, AWS Lambda, or a cheap VPS) to appear as a zero-rated service.
- **Traffic Shaping:** Only essential QMOI traffic is routed through the proxy to minimize detection and maximize reliability.
- **Auto-Testing:** QMOI tests all endpoints regularly and logs performance, switching as needed.
- **Security:** All traffic is encrypted and authenticated.

## 4. QCity UI Integration
- **Master Panel:**
  - Real-time status of zero-rated connectivity (active, fallback, last used, logs).
  - Controls to force zero-rated mode, test endpoints, and view logs.
  - Only visible to master users.
- **Settings (All Users):**
  - Option: "Always use QMOI Zero Rated for auto-connection" (toggle).
  - Description: "When enabled, QMOI will always attempt to use zero-rated internet for connectivity."
  - Status indicator: Shows if zero-rated mode is active.

---

## 5. Global Use Cases
- **Travel:** QMOI users can stay connected anywhere, even with no data plan.
- **Restricted Networks:** Bypass firewalls and data restrictions using zero-rated fallback.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Maintain connectivity during outages or emergencies.

---

## 6. Accountability & Reporting
- **Logs:** All zero-rated connections, switches, and failures are logged.
- **Reports:** Daily/weekly/monthly reports on zero-rated usage and performance.
- **Master Controls:** Only master users can view/export logs and force zero-rated mode.

---

## 7. Future Enhancements
- **AI Endpoint Selection:** Use AI to select the best zero-rated endpoint based on region and performance.
- **Community-Driven List:** Allow users to submit new zero-rated endpoints.
- **Integration with ISPs:** Work with ISPs to whitelist QMOI endpoints.
