# QMOI System

This is the main README for the QMOI system. It documents the automation, build, and deployment process for all QMOI and QCity apps across every device and platform.

## Build & Automation
- Use `python scripts/qmoi-app-builder.py` to build, test, and organize all apps for every device.
- All builds are cloud-offloaded for billing safety and reliability.

## Documentation
- See `ALLMDFILESREFS.md` for a full reference of all .md files and features.
- See `DOWNLOADQMOIAIAPPALLDEVICES.md` for download scripts and troubleshooting.

## Download Links
- All official download links are published at https://downloads.qmoi.app

## Troubleshooting
- If a build or download fails, QCity runners will auto-fix and re-upload the app.
