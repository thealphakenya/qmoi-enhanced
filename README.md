# QMOI System

![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/QMOI%20Build-Passing-brightgreen?style=flat-square)

Welcome to the **Quantum Master Orchestrator Intelligence (QMOI)** system — a unified build, automation, deployment, and update pipeline for **QMOI AI** and all **QCity-powered apps** across every platform and device.

---

## 🚀 Build & Automation

Use the following tools to automate and build your apps:

| Tool                                 | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `python scripts/qmoi-app-builder.py` | Full cloud-based build and test for all devices                  |
| `build_qmoi_ai.bat`                  | Quick-build for Windows `.exe` using PyInstaller + GitHub deploy |
| `qmoiexe.py`                         | All-in-one launcher (backend + GUI + tray + updater + shortcuts) |
| `auto_updater.py`                    | Auto-checks GitHub for new releases and updates locally          |

> 🚗 All builds are **cloud-offloaded** to reduce load and ensure stability across devices.

🧬 Troubleshooting
If any issue arises:

❌ Build fails

🔗 Download breaks

🖥 App won’t open or autoupdate

→ Just run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/qmoi-app-builder.py
QCity will auto-analyze the failure, rebuild the faulty target, and re-publish it to GitHub and downloads.qmoi.app.

🔁 Auto-enhanced by:
qmoiexe.py

auto_updater.py

build_qmoi_ai.bat

qmoi-app-builder.py

and QCity automation orchestration ☁️
