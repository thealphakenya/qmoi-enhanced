# Alpha-Q AI System

## üöÄ New Directory Structure & Automation Philosophy

The Alpha-Q AI system is now fully modular, automated, and future-proof. The new structure is designed for maximum error-fixing, performance, and extensibility:

- `automation/` or `tools/`: All automation, linting, error-fixing, and evolution scripts
- `ai_core/`: QMOI AI core, model, and evolution logic
- `earnvault/`: All EarnVaults backend, strategies, and UI
- `finance/`: Financial integrations (Mpesa, Airtel, etc.)
- `config/`: All configs, with schema validation
- `logs/`, `reports/`, `tests/`: Strict separation for logs, reports, and tests
- `src/`: All TypeScript/React UI, hooks, and services

**Automation Philosophy:**
- All error-fixing, linting, and evolution is fully automated and AI-driven
- Master-only controls for sensitive features (e.g., EarnVaults, financial actions)
- Modular, pluggable AI core and model management
- Secure, encrypted, and auditable for all sensitive actions

See the respective directories for detailed documentation and code for each subsystem.

# Production Setup Checklist

1. **Add Notification Credentials**
   - Edit `test_config.json` and fill in your real Slack webhook and SMTP email credentials.
   - Do NOT commit secrets to version control. Use environment variables or GitHub Secrets in production.
2. **Validate Notification Config**
   - Run `npm run validate-notification-config` to check for missing or placeholder credentials.
3. **Grant Notification Permissions**
   - Allow browser notifications when prompted by the dashboard.
4. **Test the System**
   - Trigger a problem (e.g., a lint or license error) and push to CI/CD.
   - Confirm you receive WhatsApp, Slack, and email notifications for all AI-driven fixes.
5. **Monitor the Dashboard**
   - Use the NotificationPanel on the admin dashboard for real-time visibility of all notifications and system health.
6. **Check Logs**
   - Review `logs/ai_error_fix.log` for a full audit trail.

## QMOI Permission Self-Healing, Notification, and Audit System

### Features
- **Automatic Permission Self-Healing:** QMOI checks and fixes its own file permissions at startup and periodically. If it cannot fix permissions, it runs a utility script and notifies the master.
- **Multi-Channel Notifications:** Notifies the master via desktop, WhatsApp, and email (configurable in `config/qmoi_config.json`).
- **Audit Logging:** All permission checks, fixes, and notifications are logged in `logs/qmoi_permission_audit.log`.

### Configuration
Edit `config/qmoi_config.json`:
```json
"notification_settings": {
  "desktop_notifications": true,
  "whatsapp_notifications": true,
  "email_notifications": true,
  "critical_only": false
},
"email_settings": {
  "enabled": true,
  "smtp_server": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "smtp_port": 587,
  "sender_email": "your_email@gmail.com",
  "sender_password": "your_password",
  "recipient_emails": ["master_email@gmail.com"]
}
```

### Audit Log
- All permission and notification actions are logged in `logs/qmoi_permission_audit.log`.

### Manual Permission Fix
- You can run `python scripts/qmoi_permission_fix.py` to manually fix permissions for all critical QMOI files.

### Periodic Self-Check
- QMOI checks permissions for all critical files every 10 minutes and self-heals as needed.

## QMOI Dashboard Remote Access, Authentication, and Health Checks

- The dashboard can be accessed remotely or locally, with optional HTTP Basic Auth.
- Configure in `config/qmoi_config.json`:

```json
"dashboard_settings": {
  "host": "0.0.0.0", // Use "127.0.0.1" for local only, "0.0.0.0" for remote
  "port": 5000,
  "enable_auth": false,
  "auth_username": "admin",
  "auth_password": "changeme"
},
"dashboard_health_check_interval": 60, // seconds
"dashboard_downtime_notify_threshold": 180 // seconds
```

- The controller will check dashboard health every `dashboard_health_check_interval` seconds.
- If the dashboard is down for more than `dashboard_downtime_notify_threshold` seconds, it will be restarted and a notification sent.
- All dashboard uptime/downtime events are logged and auditable.

## License Compliance

This project enforces license compliance during CI/CD. The following licenses are explicitly allowed for dependencies:

- MIT
- Apache-2.0
- BSD-2-Clause
- BSD-3-Clause
- CC0-1.0
- CCO-1.0

The allow list is managed in `.github/workflows/auto-deploy.yml` using `license-checker`. Any non-compliant license will trigger an AI error fixer and halt deployment until resolved.

## Deployment Monitoring & Uptime Alerting

- Uptime and deployment status are continuously monitored.
- Any deployment or runtime errors are logged and surfaced to the master user.
- Logs are accessible via the Vercel dashboard and system logs.
- Uptime monitoring and alerting can be configured with services like UptimeRobot, BetterStack, or Vercel's built-in analytics.

## Master-Only Dashboards & Controls

- Sensitive actions (trading, withdrawals, overrides) are only accessible to the master user.
- All such actions require explicit master approval and are logged for auditability.
- Master-only dashboards provide oversight for trading, project management, and system health.
- Unauthorized access attempts are logged and trigger alerts.
