# QMOI System

![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/QMOI%20Build-Passing-brightgreen?style=flat-square)

Welcome to the **Quantum Master Orchestrator Intelligence (QMOI)** system — a unified build, automation, deployment, and update pipeline for **QMOI AI** and all **QCity-powered apps** across every platform and device.

---

## 🚀 Build & Automation

Use the following tools to automate and build your apps:

| Tool                                 | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `python scripts/qmoi-app-builder.py` | Full cloud-based build and test for all devices                  |
| `build_qmoi_ai.bat`                  | Quick-build for Windows `.exe` using PyInstaller + GitHub deploy |
| `qmoiexe.py`                         | All-in-one launcher (backend + GUI + tray + updater + shortcuts) |
| `auto_updater.py`                    | Auto-checks GitHub for new releases and updates locally          |

> 🚗 All builds are **cloud-offloaded** to reduce load and ensure stability across devices.

📚 Documentation
ALLMDFILESREFS.md → Full index of docs, features, build scripts

DOWNLOADQMOIAIAPPALLDEVICES.md → CLI installers, troubleshooting, QR downloads

🌐 Download Links
All finalized apps are automatically published to:

👉 https://downloads.qmoi.app

If a download fails, QCity automation will auto-rebuild, fix, and restore the correct link.

🧠 QCity Automation Features

✅ Build validation across 9 platforms

🔀 Auto-update push to GitHub releases

🔧 Rebuilds for broken links or errors
🧪 Autotest monitoring and recovery

☁ Sync with qmoiexe.py and auto_updater.py to reflect latest status

Everything is coordinated end-to-end between cloud + local .exe behavior.

## 🛠 Autotest Build Status & Releases

### 📦 All Apps & Real-Time Release Tracking

All QMOI apps for every platform and app type are listed and tracked in [RELEASESTRACKS.md](./RELEASESTRACKS.md). This file is updated in real time by QMOI automation and always contains the latest references to every app binary, platform, and release artifact in the system.

**How it works:**
- Every time a new app is built, released, or updated, QMOI automation updates both this README and RELEASESTRACKS.md.
- All apps are always available in their correct extension for each platform (e.g., `.apk` for Android, `.exe` for Windows, `.dmg` for Mac, etc.).
- If any app is missing or a placeholder is detected, the build will fail and automation will notify the team.

**See also:** [RELEASESTRACKS.md](./RELEASESTRACKS.md) for the full, real-time list of all apps and binaries.

## 🔔 Auto-Update & Notification System

All QMOI apps (all types, all platforms) include a built-in auto-update and notification system:

- **Update Notifications:** Every installed app checks for new releases and notifies the user (or admin) when an update is available.
- **Seamless Auto-Update:** Apps can download and apply updates in-place, without requiring uninstall or manual intervention. This works for desktop, mobile, PWA, and device-specific builds.
- **Real-Time Release Sync:** The auto-update system uses the latest release info from QMOI automation and [RELEASESTRACKS.md](./RELEASESTRACKS.md).
- **Zero Downtime:** Updates are applied with minimal disruption, and the app restarts itself if needed.
- **Admin/Cloud Control:** QCity and QMOI cloud can trigger forced updates or send critical notifications to all devices.

**Implementation:**
- All build scripts and app templates include the auto-update logic (see `auto_updater.py`, `qmoiexe.py`, and platform-specific updaters).
- The update system is tested and validated for every platform and app type.

---
## 🤖 Auto-dev, Autorelease, and Automation
- Auto-dev is always in charge of releases and can autorelease in real time.
- All automations, research, and evolution are managed by auto-dev.
- All apps and PWAs are built, autotested, and published for every platform automatically.

🧬 Troubleshooting
If any issue arises:

❌ Build fails

🔗 Download breaks

🖥 App won’t open or autoupdate

→ Just run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/qmoi-app-builder.py
QCity will auto-analyze the failure, rebuild the faulty target, and re-publish it to GitHub and downloads.qmoi.app.

🔁 Auto-enhanced by:
qmoiexe.py

auto_updater.py

build_qmoi_ai.bat

qmoi-app-builder.py

and QCity automation orchestration ☁️

yaml
