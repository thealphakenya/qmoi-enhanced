## 🚀 New: Invention Project Support (Admin/Sister Only)
- AI can now create, manage, and auto-initiate invention projects exclusively for admin (Victor Kwemoi) and his sister (Leah Chebet).
- Invention projects are prioritized for business, welfare, and national impact goals.
- All invention project data and user credentials are stored with strong encryption and are never exposed in exports or unzipped builds.

## 🛡️ AI Protector & Life Goals Engine
- AI now learns, tracks, and assists with admin/sister life goals, ambitions, and future plans (e.g., protection, welfare, mental health, finances, security, business, inventions, leadership, philanthropy).
- QI dashboard now includes a secure, admin/sister-only section to view, add, or edit these goals.
- AI proactively suggests and manages projects to help achieve these ambitions.
- All sensitive data is encrypted and access-controlled.

## 🏠 Local-First AI Protector Blueprint (Planned/Roadmap)
- Local deployment of vision/audio models (YOLO, OpenCV, whisper.cpp, etc.) for home/office protection.
- Sensor/camera/mic integration, anomaly detection, and local-only alert/response.
- Dashboard UI for live feeds, logs, device control, and explainable AI decisions.
- Full offline/edge operation, no cloud/API dependency.

# ⚡️ Fast Project Bootstrap & Debugging

For Alpha-Q AI, use these best-practice commands and scripts to quickly install, debug, and run the project without slow, repetitive cycles.

## 🚀 Fastest Commands

### Install with lockfile and cache
```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline
```

### Strict peer dependencies
```bash
pnpm install --strict-peer-dependencies
```

### Diagnose and fix packages
```bash
pnpm doctor
pnpm why react
```

### Batch lint and type-check
```bash
pnpm lint --fix
pnpm tsc --noEmit
```

### Pre-bundle (Vite)
```bash
pnpm vite --force
```

### Interactive update
```bash
pnpm update --interactive
```

### Parallel install + dev
```bash
pnpm add -D concurrently
concurrently "pnpm install" "pnpm dev"
```

## 🧠 Automation Script
Create `quickstart.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "🔧 Verifying lockfile and installing deps..."
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline

echo "🔍 Type checking and linting..."
pnpm lint --fix
pnpm tsc --noEmit

echo "🚀 Starting dev server..."
pnpm dev
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x quickstart.sh
./quickstart.sh
```
