# QMOI - Quantum Mind of Intelligence

## Overview
QMOI is a fully automated, AI-powered, self-healing, and revenue-generating system that manages, deploys, and enhances all your projects, products, and services. It features advanced parallelization, error-fixing, marketing automation, and comprehensive reporting‚Äîall visualized in a real-time dashboard. QMOI is cloud-native, ultra-lightweight, and never uses your device resources. **All documentation (.md files) is always kept up to date.**

## üöÄ Always-On Hugging Face Sync
- QMOI is always kept in sync with Hugging Face (alphaqmoi/qmoi), auto-pushing all updates, auto-creating repos if missing, and retrying on failure.
- The dashboard shows real-time status, logs, and history of all Hugging Face syncs, including time, date, and result.
- Master receives notifications for every sync event (start, progress, completion, failure).

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Error Fixing (All Platforms)
- QMOI fixes all errors and problems, including those requiring developer/manual intervention, across GitLab, Vercel, Hugging Face, Colab, Dagshub, GitHub, and more.
- QMOI auto-installs all missing dependencies, files, and packages, and can create/fix scripts as needed.
- If an error requires a developer, QMOI simulates real-person reasoning, applies best practices, and logs all actions for review.
- All error-fix events are visualized in the dashboard, with real-time logs and notifications.

## üìß Enhanced Notification System
- Master is notified by email (and other channels) when a fix or deployment starts, with progress updates and completion/failure notifications.
- GitLab notifications are enhanced: you receive start, progress, and completion/failure emails for every pipeline, job, and fix.
- All notifications are configurable and can be filtered by event type, platform, or severity.

## ‚ö° QMOIALWAYSPARALLEL-Powered Parallel Error Fixing
- QMOI uses its advanced parallel engine (see QMOIALWAYSPARALLEL.md) to fix errors, install missing files/packages, and run automations in parallel across all platforms.
- Multiple fixes, installs, and deployments can run at the same time, maximizing speed and uptime.
- The dashboard visualizes all parallel jobs, their status, and results in real time.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Developer/Real-Person Capabilities
- QMOI now simulates a real developer: it can reason about complex errors, apply manual fixes, and even write new scripts or code as needed.
- QMOI can review logs, suggest improvements, and document all changes for audit and learning.
- Master can review, approve, or override any automated or manual fix from the dashboard.

## üÜì QMOI GitLab, Vercel, and Quantum: More Than the Originals
- QMOI GitLab, Vercel, and Quantum provide all paid/subscription features for free, including unlimited parallel jobs, advanced analytics, and premium integrations.
- QMOI GitLab includes features not available in standard GitLab: auto-mirroring, failover, enhanced notifications, and developer-level error fixing.
- QMOI Vercel and Quantum offer unlimited deployments, advanced monitoring, and self-healing for all users.
- All features are visualized and managed in the QMOI dashboard, with full audit logs and documentation.

## Master-only QCity panel for managing Gitpod and QMOI-local workspaces: start, stop, clone, sync, with full audit and fallback if Gitpod is unavailable.
- All workspace management actions (start, stop, clone, sync for both Gitpod and local workspaces) are now fully audit-logged in logs/qcity_audit.log.
- Notifications for all workspace events and errors are sent via all configured channels (email, Slack, WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, etc.).
- The QCity dashboard streams real-time logs for all workspace actions and displays audit/notification status.
