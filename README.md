# ⚡️ Fast Project Bootstrap & Debugging

For Alpha-Q AI, use these best-practice commands and scripts to quickly install, debug, and run the project without slow, repetitive cycles.

## 🚀 Fastest Commands

### Install with lockfile and cache
```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline
```

### Strict peer dependencies
```bash
pnpm install --strict-peer-dependencies
```

### Diagnose and fix packages
```bash
pnpm doctor
pnpm why react
```

### Batch lint and type-check
```bash
pnpm lint --fix
pnpm tsc --noEmit
```

### Pre-bundle (Vite)
```bash
pnpm vite --force
```

### Interactive update
```bash
pnpm update --interactive
```

### Parallel install + dev
```bash
pnpm add -D concurrently
concurrently "pnpm install" "pnpm dev"
```

## 🧠 Automation Script
Create `quickstart.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "🔧 Verifying lockfile and installing deps..."
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline

echo "🔍 Type checking and linting..."
pnpm lint --fix
pnpm tsc --noEmit

echo "🚀 Starting dev server..."
pnpm dev
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x quickstart.sh
./quickstart.sh
```
