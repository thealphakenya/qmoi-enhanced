## 🛠️ Auto-Updating & Permanent Documentation
- All .md files are auto-updated after every automation cycle, and always include the latest direct download links for every app and platform (see QMOIAPPS.md and DOWNLOADQMOIAIAPPALLDEVICES.md).
- All app binaries for every platform are automatically built and published by QMOI's CI/CD automation (see .gitlab-ci.yml), ensuring actual apps are always available for download and install.
- Documentation confirms that every app can be downloaded, transferred (e.g. via USB), and installed offline on any device, without requiring a download or internet connection.
- All download links are autotested and auto-fixed by QCity runners, with fallback to ngrok or Freenom if needed (see QMOINGROK.md).
- All official download links use https://downloads.qmoi.app for every app and platform, as documented in QMOIAPPS.md and DOWNLOADQMOIAIAPPALLDEVICES.md.
- Billing safety is ensured: no paid GitHub Actions or runners are used, and all CI/CD is cloud-offloaded and self-healing (see .gitlab-ci.yml).
- New files and features are automatically added to this reference.
- **Ngrok Integration:** QMOI supports ngrok as a secure, automated tunnel provider for download and service links. See QMOINGROK.md for details.
- For troubleshooting, see DOWNLOADQMOIAIAPPALLDEVICES.md and QMOIBROWSER.md for autotesting and auto-fix logic.

## 🚀 Universal Device Installation & Optimization
- Every QMOI app is built, packaged, and signed using platform-specific best practices (Android Studio, Xcode, Electron, PyInstaller, etc.) for maximum compatibility and trust.
- Automated installation instructions, dependencies, and system requirements are provided and updated for every device type in INSTALLATION.md and README.md.
- All binaries are verified and signed to avoid permission or trust issues on any device.
- Device-specific enhancements are included:
  - Android: Universal APK/App Bundle, architecture checks, auto-update, voice control, offline mode, parsing error auto-fix.
  - Windows: 64-bit .exe, architecture match, digital signing, SmartScreen bypass, system tray, touchscreen, widgets.
  - macOS: .dmg/.app, code signing, Apple Silicon support, Spotlight/Siri integration.
  - Linux: .AppImage/.deb/.rpm, execute permissions, CLI/daemon/cron, dependency auto-check.
  - iOS: .ipa, TestFlight/App Store, Siri shortcuts, Face ID, push notifications.
  - Chromebook: APK/PWA/Linux app, Play Store/Web, Google Drive sync, offline mode, hybrid UI.
  - Raspberry Pi: ARMv7/ARM64 .deb, GPIO/sensor integration, energy-efficient always-on node.
  - Smart TV: TV APK/Web app, ADB/USB sideload, voice remote, dashboard, automation status.

- All .md files are auto-updated to reflect the latest installation, troubleshooting, and optimization logic for every platform and device.
- Summary tables and platform-specific guides are maintained and auto-updated for reference and support.

## 🛡️ Automated Build, Install, and Error-Fix Strategies
- All builds now include:
  - Architecture auto-detection and packaging for each device (e.g., x64 for Windows, arm64-v8a for Android, universal for macOS).
  - Automated dependency bundling (DLLs, redistributables, drivers) for each platform.
  - Digital signing and notarization for Windows, macOS, and Android binaries.
  - Post-build install simulation and autotest for every device type (using emulators/VMs where possible).
  - Auto-fix logic: If install errors (e.g., "This app can't run on your PC", parsing errors, permission issues) are detected, the build pipeline auto-rebuilds, re-signs, repackages, and re-tests until successful.
  - Lightweight optimization: All binaries are compressed and stripped for minimal size and maximum performance.
- Troubleshooting and auto-fix strategies are documented for each platform in INSTALLATION.md and QMOIALLDEVICESINSTALL.md.
- All download links are autotested and auto-fixed after every build, with verification reports included in documentation.
- All .md files and install guides are auto-updated to reflect the latest error-fix logic and install success rates for every device.

## 🎨 Icon & Notification Customization
- All QMOI apps now feature a unified, modern icon with the (Q') initial for instant brand recognition across all devices and platforms.
- Icons are optimized for each platform (SVG, PNG, ICO, ICNS, adaptive Android XML, etc.) and auto-generated for every build.
- Notification icons and settings are customized for each device:
  - Android: Adaptive icon, notification channel, custom sound.
  - Windows: System tray icon, toast notifications, quick settings.
  - macOS: Dock icon, notification center, badge updates.
