## Automation & Visualization of Documentation History
- QMOI provides a real-time dashboard to visualize documentation update history, including:
  - Timeline and frequency of changes
  - Most frequently updated files
  - Change analytics (by file, by time, by user)
  - Filtering and search by file name or date
- All update events are visualized as interactive charts and tables in the dashboard.
- QMOI can send notifications for documentation changes, failures, or unusual activity.
- If a documentation update fails, QMOI triggers error-fix automation and logs the event.
- The master can export, filter, or audit the update history at any time.
- All documentation analytics are integrated with the main QMOI dashboard and notification system.
