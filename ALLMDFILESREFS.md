# QMOI System
![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/QMOI%20Build-Passing-brightgreen?style=flat-square)
Welcome to the **Quantum Master Orchestrator Intelligence (QMOI)** system — a unified build, automation, deployment, and update pipeline for **QMOI AI** and all **QCity-powered apps** across every platform and device.
---
## 🚀 Build & Automation
Use the following tools to automate and build your apps:
| Tool                                 | Description                                                      |

## README_SYNC.md

``
Sync helper
This repository is a public copy used to edit and test before pushing to the private `qmoi-enhanced` repository owned by `thealphakenya`.
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your personal access token (PAT) with repo permissions.
2. Never commit `.env` or tokens. The root `.gitignore` prevents `.env` from being added.
3. To push local changes to the private upstream (uses token from `.env`):
   source .env && ./scripts/push_to_upstream.sh "your commit message"
   The script will create or update a remote named `upstream` that points to the private upstream and push the current branch to `main` by default.
Security note: Using token-embedded remote URLs stores the token only in Git's remote URL (visible via `git remote -v`). Consider using a credential helper or GitHub CLI for more secure workflows.
``

## ROTATE_TOKEN.md

``
Rotate exposed PAT (urgent)
Because a PAT was temporarily present in local files, rotate it immediately for the `thealphakenya` account.
Steps:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens (sign in as `thealphakenya`).
2. Revoke the old token `ghp_...` (if visible) or click the token you want to revoke and delete it.
3. Create a new token with the minimal `repo` scope required.
4. In this repository (https://github.com/thevictorofkenya/qmoi-enhanced-new-thevictorofkenya), go to Settings -> Secrets -> Actions and add `UPSTREAM_PAT` with the new token value.
5. Locally, remove any `.env` files and avoid committing tokens.
``

## SYNCORCHESTOR.md

``
# Sync Orchestrator Design and Operational Plan
This document describes the Sync Orchestrator for QMOI and QCity: a global orchestration layer that keeps apps, runners, engines, machines, servers, databases and resources in sync across platforms.
Goals
- Provide a single control plane that ensures every QMOI/QCity resource (apps, runners, servers, databases, machines) is in the desired state.
- Ensure the orchestrator runs on highly-available Linux machines with elastic resources.
- Provide secure, token-based operations using repository secrets tied to `thealphakenya`.
Core capabilities
- Continuous discovery and heartbeat: detect resources and maintain liveness.
``

## SYNC_INSTRUCTIONS.md

``
Auto-sync instructions
This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that will push changes made to `main` here to the private repository `thealphakenya/qmoi-enhanced`.
Setup steps (owner of this repo must do these in repo settings):
1. Add the secret `UPSTREAM_PAT` to this repository (prefer using the web UI or the GitHub CLI):
	Web UI:
	- Settings -> Secrets & variables -> Actions -> New repository secret
	- Name: UPSTREAM_PAT
	- Paste the new PAT (with `repo` scope) and save.
``

## SYNC_RUNBOOK.md

``
Sync runbook
==============
Required secret: UPSTREAM_PAT
- The `UPSTREAM_PAT` secret must be a PAT that belongs to an account with write access to the upstream repository `thealphakenya/qmoi-enhanced`.
- Classic PAT: must include `repo` scope (full). Fine-grained PAT: must include Repository access -> Code -> Read & write (or Write) for the upstream repo.
- If the upstream repo belongs to an organization, ensure the token owner has SSO access enabled and approved for that org.
How the workflow works (summary)
- The workflow creates a sync branch in the public repo and pushes it to `origin`.

- **Self-Healing & Error-Free Downloads:** App downloads are only enabled if all health checks and autotests pass. Apps are always up to date, error-free, and auto-updating after install.
- **Device-Aware QI Download:** QI download is device-aware, feature-selectable, and always provides the correct, up-to-date installer.
- **Expanded Platform Stats:** Dashboard now shows status for GitLab, GitHub, Vercel, Gitpod, Netlify, HuggingFace, Quantum, Village, Azure, AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, and more, each with icons and names.

# Webhook Receiver and Best Practices
This file describes how QMOI should receive and validate GitHub webhooks.
Best practices:
- Use a verification secret and validate X-Hub-Signature-256 header
- Reject unknown event types early and return 2xx only for accepted events
- Use an event queue (e.g., Redis/RabbitMQ/Kafka) to decouple processing
Example receiver (pseudo):
1. Verify signature

# ipaddr.js — an IPv6 and IPv4 address manipulation library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/whitequark/ipaddr.js.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/whitequark/ipaddr.js)
ipaddr.js is a small (1.9K minified and gzipped) library for manipulating
IP addresses in JavaScript environments. It runs on both CommonJS runtimes
(e.g. [nodejs]) and in a web browser.
ipaddr.js allows you to verify and parse string representation of an IP
address, match it against a CIDR range or range list, determine if it falls
into some reserved ranges (examples include loopback and private ranges),
and convert between IPv4 and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.

## qmoi-enhanced/dashboard/node_modules/js-tokens/CHANGELOG.md

``
### Version 4.0.0 (2018-01-28) ###
- Added: Support for ES2018. The only change needed was recognizing the `s`
  regex flag.
- Changed: _All_ tokens returned by the `matchToToken` function now have a
  `closed` property. It is set to `undefined` for the tokens where “closed”
  doesn’t make sense. This means that all tokens objects have the same shape,
  which might improve performance.
These are the breaking changes:

### 🐞 Bug fixes
* Handle split surrogate pairs when encoding utf8 - by [@yosion-p](https://github.com/yosion-p) and [@ashtuchkin](https://github.com/ashtuchkin) in [#282](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/pull/282):
    Handle a case where streaming utf8 encoder (converting js strings -> buffers) encounters
    surrogate pairs split between chunks (last character of one chunk is high surrogate and first
    character of the next chunk is a low surrogate).
* Avoid false positives in encodingExists by using objects without a prototype - by [@bjohansebas](https://github.com/bjohansebas) in [#328](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/pull/328)
    The encodingExists method could return incorrect results if the lookup matched properties inherited

# `react`
React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.
The `react` package contains only the functionality necessary to define React components. It is typically used together with a React renderer like `react-dom` for the web, or `react-native` for the native environments.
**Note:** by default, React will be in development mode. The development version includes extra warnings about common mistakes, whereas the production version includes extra performance optimizations and strips all error messages. Don't forget to use the [production build](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build) when deploying your application.
## Usage
```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
``

## qmoi-enhanced/dashboard/node_modules/react-dom/README.md

``
# `react-dom`
This package serves as the entry point to the DOM and server renderers for React. It is intended to be paired with the generic React package, which is shipped as `react` to npm.
## Installation
```sh
npm install react react-dom
```
## Usage

# QMOI GitHub Actions Self-Healing CI/CD Automation
## Overview
QMOI now supports self-healing automation for GitHub Actions workflows. The system can:
- Fetch the latest failed workflow run via the GitHub API
- Detect and auto-fix common errors (e.g., typos, missing dependencies)
- Commit, push, and trigger a workflow re-run via the GitHub API
- Notify via Slack/email if persistent failures occur

# QMOI GitLab Self-Healing CI/CD Automation
## Overview
QMOI now includes a self-healing automation script for GitLab CI/CD. This script automatically detects and fixes common errors in `.gitlab-ci.yml` (such as typos in script paths), commits the fix, pushes it, and triggers a new pipeline. All actions are logged for audit and debugging.
## How It Works
- On pipeline failure, the script fetches the latest failed job log using the GitLab API.
- It scans for common errors (e.g., `No such file or directory`, `command not found`).
- If a typo in a file path is detected, it uses fuzzy matching to suggest and apply the correct path.
- The script patches `.gitlab-ci.yml`, commits, pushes, and triggers a new pipeline.

# Troubleshooting Guide
## PowerShell Display Issues
### PSReadLine Errors
- If you see errors like `Actual value was 1. at System.Console.SetCursorPosition`, this is a known PowerShell/Windows issue with long output or commit messages.
- **Workarounds:**
  - Use shorter commit messages, or use `git commit -F message.txt` to commit with a file.
  - Use Git Bash or WSL for a more robust terminal experience.
  - Upgrade PowerShell and PSReadLine to the latest version.

#### Utility methods for the hapi ecosystem.
**hoek** is part of the **hapi** ecosystem and was designed to work seamlessly with the [hapi web framework](https://hapi.dev) and its other components (but works great on its own or with other frameworks). If you are using a different web framework and find this module useful, check out [hapi](https://hapi.dev) – they work even better together.
This module is not intended to solve every problem for everyone, but rather as a central place to store hapi-specific methods. If you're looking for a general purpose utility module, check out [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash).

Essentially, this is the same API as

## qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/@jest/create-cache-key-function/README.md

``
# jest-create-cache-key-function
This module creates a function which is used for generating cache keys used by code transformers in Jest.
## Install
```sh
$ npm install --save-dev @jest/create-cache-key-function

## API
### `createCacheKey(files?: Array<string>, values?: Array<String>, length?: number): GetCacheKeyFunction`
``

## qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/@jest/schemas/README.md

``
# `@jest/schemas`
Experimental and currently incomplete module for JSON schemas for [Jest's](https://jestjs.io/) configuration.

``
# @jest/types
This package contains shared types of Jest's packages.
If you are looking for types of [Jest globals](https://jestjs.io/docs/api), you can import them from `@jest/globals` package:
```ts
import {describe, expect, it} from '@jest/globals';
describe('my tests', () => {
  it('works', () => {
    expect(1).toBe(1);

## qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/@jridgewell/gen-mapping/README.md

``
# @jridgewell/gen-mapping
> Generate source maps
`gen-mapping` allows you to generate a source map during transpilation or minification.
With a source map, you're able to trace the original location in the source file, either in Chrome's
DevTools or using a library like [`@jridgewell/trace-mapping`][trace-mapping].
You may already be familiar with the [`source-map`][source-map] package's `SourceMapGenerator`. This
provides the same `addMapping` and `setSourceContent` API.
## Installation
``

## qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/@jridgewell/remapping/README.md

``
# @jridgewell/remapping
> Remap sequential sourcemaps through transformations to point at the original source code
Remapping allows you to take the sourcemaps generated through transforming your code and "remap"
them to the original source locations. Think "my minified code, transformed with babel and bundled
with webpack", all pointing to the correct location in your original source code.
With remapping, none of your source code transformations need to be aware of the input's sourcemap,
they only need to generate an output sourcemap. This greatly simplifies building custom
transformations (think a find-and-replace).

> Resolve a URI relative to an optional base URI
Resolve any combination of absolute URIs, protocol-realtive URIs, absolute paths, or relative paths.
## Installation
```sh

## qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/@jridgewell/source-map/README.md

``
# @jridgewell/source-map
> Packages `@jridgewell/trace-mapping` and `@jridgewell/gen-mapping` into the familiar source-map API
This isn't the full API, but it's the core functionality. This wraps
[@jridgewell/trace-mapping][trace-mapping] and [@jridgewell/gen-mapping][gen-mapping]
implementations.
## Installation
```sh
npm install @jridgewell/source-map
``

## qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/@jridgewell/sourcemap-codec/README.md

``
# @jridgewell/sourcemap-codec
Encode/decode the `mappings` property of a [sourcemap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit).
## Why?
Sourcemaps are difficult to generate and manipulate, because the `mappings` property – the part that actually links the generated code back to the original source – is encoded using an obscure method called [Variable-length quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity). On top of that, each segment in the mapping contains offsets rather than absolute indices, which means that you can't look at a segment in isolation – you have to understand the whole sourcemap.
This package makes the process slightly easier.
## Installation
```bash
npm install @jridgewell/sourcemap-codec
``

## qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/@jridgewell/trace-mapping/README.md

``
# @jridgewell/trace-mapping
> Trace the original position through a source map
`trace-mapping` allows you to take the line and column of an output file and trace it to the
original location in the source file through a source map.
You may already be familiar with the [`source-map`][source-map] package's `SourceMapConsumer`. This
provides the same `originalPositionFor` and `generatedPositionFor` API, without requiring WASM.

If you're upgrading from the original `open` package (`open@0.0.5` or lower), keep in mind that the API is different.
#### Why?
- Actively maintained.
- Supports app arguments.
- Safer as it uses `spawn` instead of `exec`.

JavaScript implementation of the timer APIs; `setTimeout`, `clearTimeout`, `setImmediate`, `clearImmediate`, `setInterval`, `clearInterval`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `cancelAnimationFrame`, `requestIdleCallback`, and `cancelIdleCallback`, along with a clock instance that controls the flow of time. [PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]Timers also provides a `Date` implementation that gets its time from the clock.
In addition in browser environment `@sinonjs/[PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]-timers` provides a `performance` implementation that gets its time from the clock. In Node environments [PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]Timers provides a `nextTick` implementation that is synchronized with the clock - and a `process.hrtime` shim that works with the clock.
`@sinonjs/[PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]-timers` can be used to simulate passing time in automated tests and other
situations where you want the scheduling semantics, but don't want to actually
wait.

======
Javascript module to match a string against a regular expression, glob, string,
or function that takes the string as an argument and returns a truthy or falsy
value. The matcher can also be an array of any or all of these. Useful for
allowing a very flexible user-defined config to define things like file paths.
__Note: This module has Bash-parity, please be aware that Windows-style backslashes are not supported as separators. See https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#backslashes for more information.__

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kriskowal/asap.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kriskowal/asap)

callback until the next available event.
(See [Designing API’s for Asynchrony][Zalgo].)
The `asap` function executes a task **as soon as possible** but not before it
returns, waiting only for the completion of the current event and previously

By the [W3C WebDX Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/) and contributors.
`baseline-browser-mapping` provides:
- An `Array` of browsers compatible with Baseline Widely available and Baseline year feature sets via the [`getCompatibleVersions()` function](#get-baseline-widely-available-browser-versions-or-baseline-year-browser-versions).
- An `Array`, `Object` or `CSV` as a string describing the Baseline feature set support of all browser versions included in the module's data set via the [`getAllVersions()` function](#get-data-for-all-browser-versions).
You can use `baseline-browser-mapping` to help you determine minimum browser version support for your chosen Baseline feature set; or to analyse the level of support for different Baseline feature sets in your site's traffic by joining the data with your analytics data.

# bl *(BufferList)*
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/rvagg/bl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rvagg/bl/)
**A Node.js Buffer list collector, reader and streamer thingy.**
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/bl.svg)](https://nodei.co/npm/bl/)
**bl** is a storage object for collections of Node Buffers, exposing them with the main Buffer readable API. Also works as a duplex stream so you can collect buffers from a stream that emits them and emit buffers to a stream that consumes them!
The original buffers are kept intact and copies are only done as necessary. Any reads that require the use of a single original buffer will return a slice of that buffer only (which references the same memory as the original buffer). Reads that span buffers perform concatenation as required and return the results transparently.
```js
const { BufferList } = require('bl')

# BSER Binary Serialization
BSER is a binary serialization scheme that can be used as an alternative to JSON.
BSER uses a framed encoding that makes it simpler to use to stream a sequence of
encoded values.
It is intended to be used for local-IPC only and strings are represented as binary
with no specific encoding; this matches the convention employed by most operating
system filename storage.
For more details about the serialization scheme see

Color-convert is a color conversion library for JavaScript and node.
It converts all ways between `rgb`, `hsl`, `hsv`, `hwb`, `cmyk`, `ansi`, `ansi16`, `hex` strings, and CSS `keyword`s (will round to closest):
```js
var convert = require('color-convert');
convert.rgb.hsl(140, 200, 100);             // [96, 48, 59]
convert.keyword.rgb('blue');                // [0, 0, 255]

# combined-stream
A stream that emits multiple other streams one after another.
**NB** Currently `combined-stream` works with streams version 1 only. There is ongoing effort to switch this library to streams version 2. Any help is welcome. :) Meanwhile you can explore other libraries that provide streams2 support with more or less compatibility with `combined-stream`.
- [combined-stream2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/combined-stream2): A drop-in streams2-compatible replacement for the combined-stream module.

# emoji-regex [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/mathiasbynens/emoji-regex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mathiasbynens/emoji-regex)
_emoji-regex_ offers a regular expression to match all emoji symbols (including textual representations of emoji) as per the Unicode Standard.
This repository contains a script that generates this regular expression based on [the data from Unicode v12](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/unicode-12.0.0). Because of this, the regular expression can easily be updated whenever new emoji are added to the Unicode standard.

# fs.realpath
A backwards-compatible fs.realpath for Node v6 and above
In Node v6, the JavaScript implementation of fs.realpath was replaced
with a faster (but less resilient) native implementation.  That raises
new and platform-specific errors and cannot handle long or excessively
symlink-looping paths.
This module handles those cases by detecting the new errors and
falling back to the JavaScript implementation.  On versions of Node

This module allows for developers to write common code that can share
implementation details, hiding whether an underlying request happens
synchronously or asynchronously. This is in contrast with many current Node
APIs which explicitly implement the same API twice, once with calls to
synchronous functions, and once with asynchronous functions.
Take for example `fs.readFile` and `fs.readFileSync`, if you're writing an API
that loads a file and then performs a synchronous operation on the data, it

## qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/hermes-parser/README.md

``
# hermes-parser
A JavaScript parser built from the Hermes engine's parser compiled to WebAssembly. Can parse ES6, Flow, and JSX syntax.
## API
The Hermes parser exposes a single `parse(code, [options])` function, where `code` is the source code to parse as a string, and `options` is an optional object that may contain the following properties:
- **babel**: `boolean`, defaults to `false`. If `true`, output an AST conforming to Babel's AST format. If `false`, output an AST conforming to the ESTree AST format.
- **allowReturnOutsideFunction**: `boolean`, defaults to `false`. If `true`, do not error on return statements found outside functions.
- **flow**: `"all"` or `"detect"`, defaults to `"detect"`. If `"detect"`, only parse syntax as Flow syntax where it is ambiguous whether it is a Flow feature or regular JavaScript when the `@flow` pragma is present in the file. Otherwise if `"all"`, always parse ambiguous syntax as Flow syntax regardless of the presence of an `@flow` pragma. For example `foo<T>(x)` in a file without an `@flow` pragma will be parsed as two comparisons if set to `"detect"`, otherwise if set to `"all"` or the `@flow` pragma is included it will be parsed as a call expression with a type argument.
- **sourceFilename**: `string`, defaults to `null`. The filename corresponding to the code that is to be parsed. If non-null, the filename will be added to all source locations in the output AST.

### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.
Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.

iMurmurHash.js
==============
An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).
This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.
Installation
------------
To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/istanbuljs/istanbul-lib-instrument.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/istanbuljs/istanbul-lib-instrument)
Istanbul instrumenter library.
Version 1.1.x now implements instrumentation using `Babel`. The implementation is inspired
by prior art by @dtinth as [PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]nstrated in the `__coverage__` babel plugin.
It provides 2 "modes" of instrumentation.
-   The old API that is mostly unchanged (except for incompatibilities noted) and
    performs the instrumentation using babel as a library.

``
# jest-[PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]
**Note:** More details on user side API can be found in [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/[PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]-function-api).
## API
```js
import {Module[PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]er} from 'jest-[PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]';
```
### `constructor(global)`
Creates a new module [PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]er that generates [PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]s as if they were created in an environment with the given global object.

## qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/jest-util/Readme.md

``
# `@jest/utils`
This packages is a collection of utilities and helper functions
## `ErrorWithStack`
This custom error class can be useful when you need to capture the stack trace of an error and provide additional context to the error message. By default, JavaScript errors only capture the stack trace when they are thrown, but this class allows you to capture the stack trace at any point in your code by calling its constructor.
## `clearLine`
It ensures that the clearing operation is only performed when running in a terminal environment, and not when the output is redirected to a file or another non-terminal destination.
## `convertDescriptorToString`
It defines a function named `convertDescriptorToString` that takes a descriptor as input and converts it to a string based on its type. It handles various types such as functions, numbers, strings, and undefined values. If the input doesn't match any of these types, it throws an error with a descriptive message.

## qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/jest-worker/README.md

``
# jest-worker
Module for executing heavy tasks under forked processes in parallel, by providing a `Promise` based interface, minimum overhead, and bound workers.
The module works by providing an absolute path of the module to be loaded in all forked processes. All methods are exposed on the parent process as promises, so they can be `await`'ed. Child (worker) methods can either be synchronous or asynchronous.
The module also implements support for bound workers. Binding a worker means that, based on certain parameters, the same task will always be executed by the same worker. The way bound workers work is by using the returned string of the `computeWorkerKey` method. If the string was used before for a task, the call will be queued to the related worker that processed the task earlier; if not, it will be executed by the first available worker, then sticked to the worker that executed it; so the next time it will be processed by the same worker. If you have no preference on the worker executing the task, but you have defined a `computeWorkerKey` method because you want _some_ of the tasks to be sticked, you can return `null` from it.
The list of exposed methods can be explicitly provided via the `exposedMethods` option. If it is not provided, it will be obtained by requiring the child module into the main process, and analyzed via reflection. Check the "minimal example" section for a valid one.
## Install
```sh
yarn add jest-worker

### Version 4.0.0 (2018-01-28) ###
- Added: Support for ES2018. The only change needed was recognizing the `s`
  regex flag.
- Changed: _All_ tokens returned by the `matchToToken` function now have a
  `closed` property. It is set to `undefined` for the tokens where “closed”
  doesn’t make sense. This means that all tokens objects have the same shape,
  which might improve performance.
These are the breaking changes:

## qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/jsc-safe-url/README.md

``
## `jsc-safe-url`
JavaScriptCore santizes source URLs in error stacks by stripping query strings and fragments. Ref: [`Webkit/Webkit#49109d`](https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/commit/49109db4ab87a715f7a8987c7ee380e63060298b).
This package contains utility functions required to implement the proposed [React Native Community RFC0646](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/pull/646). It exports three functons:
## `function isJscSafeUrl(url: string): boolean`
Returns `false` if the URL has a query component that could be stripped by JSC.
## `function toJscSafeUrl(urlToConvert: string): string`
Accepts an absolute or relative URL, and encodes any data in the input query string (if present) into the [path component](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.3) of the URL, by using the delimiter `//&` (which cannot appear in a normalized file path) to separate the original path from the orignal query string.
```
``

## qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/jsesc/README.md

``
# jsesc
Given some data, _jsesc_ returns a stringified representation of that data. jsesc is similar to `JSON.stringify()` except:
1. it outputs JavaScript instead of JSON [by default](#json), enabling support for data structures like ES6 maps and sets;
2. it offers [many options](#api) to customize the output;
3. its output is ASCII-safe [by default](#minimal), thanks to its use of [escape sequences](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-escapes) where needed.
For any input, jsesc generates the shortest possible valid printable-ASCII-only output. [Here’s an online [PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED].](https://mothereff.in/js-escapes)
jsesc’s output can be used instead of `JSON.stringify`’s to avoid [mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake) and other encoding issues, or even to [avoid errors](https://twitter.com/annevk/status/380000829643571200) when passing JSON-formatted data (which may contain U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR, U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR, or [lone surrogates](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/code-points-vs-unicode-scalar-values#content-14)) to a JavaScript parser or an UTF-8 encoder.

# Metro
🚇 The JavaScript bundler for React Native.
- **🚅 Fast**: We aim for sub-second reload cycles, fast startup and quick bundling speeds.
- **⚖️ Scalable**: Works with thousands of modules in a single application.
- **⚛️ Integrated**: Supports every React Native project out of the box.
This project was previously part of the [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) repository. In this smaller repository it is easier for the team working on Metro to respond to both issues and pull requests. See [react-native#13976](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/13976) for the initial announcement.

# hermes-estree

## qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/metro/node_modules/hermes-parser/README.md

``
# hermes-parser
A JavaScript parser built from the Hermes engine's parser compiled to WebAssembly. Can parse ES6, Flow, and JSX syntax.
## API
The Hermes parser exposes a single `parse(code, [options])` function, where `code` is the source code to parse as a string, and `options` is an optional object that may contain the following properties:
- **babel**: `boolean`, defaults to `false`. If `true`, output an AST conforming to Babel's AST format. If `false`, output an AST conforming to the ESTree AST format.
- **allowReturnOutsideFunction**: `boolean`, defaults to `false`. If `true`, do not error on return statements found outside functions.
- **flow**: `"all"` or `"detect"`, defaults to `"detect"`. If `"detect"`, only parse syntax as Flow syntax where it is ambiguous whether it is a Flow feature or regular JavaScript when the `@flow` pragma is present in the file. Otherwise if `"all"`, always parse ambiguous syntax as Flow syntax regardless of the presence of an `@flow` pragma. For example `foo<T>(x)` in a file without an `@flow` pragma will be parsed as two comparisons if set to `"detect"`, otherwise if set to `"all"` or the `@flow` pragma is included it will be parsed as a call expression with a type argument.
- **sourceFilename**: `string`, defaults to `null`. The filename corresponding to the code that is to be parsed. If non-null, the filename will be added to all source locations in the output AST.

JavaScript Numbers are represented as [IEEE 754 double-precision floats](http://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/coding/ieeefloat.html).  Unfortunately, this means they lose integer precision for values beyond +/- 2^^53.  For projects that need to accurately handle 64-bit ints, such as [node-thrift](https://github.com/wadey/node-thrift), a performant, Number-like class is needed.  Int64 is that class.
Int64 instances look and feel much like JS-native Numbers.  By way of example ...
```js
// First, let's illustrate the problem ...
> (0x123456789).toString(16)
'123456789' // <- what we expect.
> (0x123456789abcdef0).toString(16)
'123456789abcdf00' // <- Ugh!  JS doesn't do big ints. :(

This is meant to be used in command-line tools and scripts, not in the browser.
If you need this for Electron, use [`shell.openPath()`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/shell#shellopenpathpath) instead.
Note: The original [`open` package](https://github.com/pwnall/node-open) was previously deprecated in favor of this package, and we got the name, so this package is now named `open` instead of `opn`. If you're upgrading from the original `open` package (`open@0.0.5` or lower), keep in mind that the API is different.
#### Why?
- Actively maintained.
- Supports app arguments.

> Check if a path exists
NOTE: `fs.existsSync` has been un-deprecated in Node.js since 6.8.0. If you only need to check synchronously, this module is not needed.
While [`fs.exists()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_exists_path_callback) is being [deprecated](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/103), there's still a genuine use-case of being able to check if a path exists for other purposes than doing IO with it.
Never use this before handling a file though:
> In particular, checking if a file exists before opening it is an anti-pattern that leaves you vulnerable to race conditions: another process may remove the file between the calls to `fs.exists()` and `fs.open()`. Just open the file and handle the error when it's not there.

# `react`
React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.
The `react` package contains only the functionality necessary to define React components. It is typically used together with a React renderer like `react-dom` for the web, or `react-native` for the native environments.
**Note:** by default, React will be in development mode. The development version includes extra warnings about common mistakes, whereas the production version includes extra performance optimizations and strips all error messages. Don't forget to use the [production build](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build) when deploying your application.
## Usage
```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

``
# `react-devtools-core`
This package provides low-level APIs to support renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). If you're looking for the standalone React DevTools UI, **we suggest using [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) instead of using this package directly**.
This package provides two entrypoints: labeled "backend" and "standalone" (frontend). Both APIs are described below.
# Backend API
Backend APIs are embedded in _development_ builds of renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) in order to connect to the React DevTools UI.
### Example
If you are building a non-browser-based React renderer, you can use the backend API like so:

1. The versions in the `package.json` of the new app template. For example [for React Native 0.68.1](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.68-stable/template/package.json#L12-L15) the versions are aligned as follows:
```
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "17.0.2",
    "react-native": "0.68.1"

### Target
A debuggable entity that a debugger frontend can connect to.
### Target Delegate
An interface between a Target class and the underlying debuggable entity. For example, HostTargetDelegate is used by HostTarget to send host-related events to the native platform implementation.
### Target Controller
A private interface exposed by a Target class to its Sessions/Agents. For example, HostTargetController is used by HostAgent to safely access the host's HostTargetDelegate, without exposing HostTarget's other private state.

# react-native-biometrics
React native biometrics is a simple bridge to native iOS and Android keystore management.  It allows you to create public private key pairs that are stored in native keystores and protected by biometric authentication.  Those keys can then be retrieved later, after proper authentication, and used to create a cryptographic signature.
## React Native Compatibility

# react-refresh
This package implements the wiring necessary to integrate Fast Refresh into bundlers. Fast Refresh is a feature that lets you edit React components in a running application without losing their state. It is similar to an old feature known as "hot reloading", but Fast Refresh is more reliable and officially supported by React.
This package is primarily aimed at developers of bundler plugins. If you’re working on one, here is a [rough guide](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16604#issuecomment-528663101) for Fast Refresh integration using this package.

# Source Map Support
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/evanw/node-source-map-support.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/evanw/node-source-map-support)
This module provides source map support for stack traces in node via the [V8 stack trace API](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Stack-Trace-API). It uses the [source-map](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map) module to replace the paths and line numbers of source-mapped files with their original paths and line numbers. The output mimics node's stack trace format with the goal of making every compile-to-JS language more of a first-class citizen. Source maps are completely general (not specific to any one language) so you can use source maps with multiple compile-to-JS languages in the same node process.
## Installation and Usage
#### Node support
```
$ npm install source-map-support
```

# sprintf.js
**sprintf.js** is a complete open source JavaScript sprintf implementation for the *browser* and *node.js*.
Its prototype is simple:
    string sprintf(string format , [mixed arg1 [, mixed arg2 [ ,...]]])
The [PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]s in the format string are marked by `%` and are followed by one or more of these elements, in this order:
* An optional number followed by a `$` sign that selects which argument index to use for the value. If not specified, arguments will be placed in the same order as the [PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]s in the input string.
* An optional `+` sign that forces to preceed the result with a plus or minus sign on numeric values. By default, only the `-` sign is used on negative numbers.
* An optional padding specifier that says what character to use for padding (if specified). Possible values are `0` or any other character precedeed by a `'` (single quote). The default is to pad with *spaces*.

# vlq.js
Convert integers to a Base64-encoded VLQ string, and vice versa. No dependencies, works in node.js or browsers, supports AMD.
## Why would you want to do that?
Sourcemaps are the most likely use case. Mappings from original source to generated content are encoded as a sequence of VLQ strings.
## What is a VLQ string?
A [variable-length quantity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity) is a compact way of encoding large integers in text (i.e. in situations where you can't transmit raw binary data). An integer represented as digits will always take up more space than the equivalent VLQ representation:

wcwidth is a simple JavaScript port of [wcwidth](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/wcswidth.3.html) implemented in C by Markus Kuhn.
JavaScript port [originally](https://github.com/mycoboco/wcwidth.js) written by Woong Jun <woong.jun@gmail.com> (http://code.woong.org/)

> Tiny queue data structure
You should use this package instead of an array if you do a lot of `Array#push()` and `Array#shift()` on large arrays, since `Array#shift()` has [linear time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(N)%E2%80%94Linear%20Time) *O(n)* while `Queue#dequeue()` has [constant time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(1)%20%E2%80%94%20Constant%20Time) *O(1)*. That makes a huge difference for large arrays.
> A [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is an ordered list of elements where an element is inserted at the end of the queue and is removed from the front of the queue. A queue works based on the first-in, first-out ([FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))) principle.

- `qmoi_build_all.py`: basic driver that scans the repo for known build markers and reports/builds.
- `deploy/qmoi-orchestrator.service`: systemd template (place in `/etc/systemd/system/` and adjust `WorkingDirectory`/`User`).
Important safety notes:
- This is a conservative scaffold: many repo files still contain placeholders and partial scripts. Review build steps before enabling `--apply` or deploying to production.

``
QMOI Orchestrator — manifest flags
This short companion file documents the manifest-related CLI flags for `qmoi_orchestrator.py`.
- --manifest-write
  If no `.qmoi/runner_manifest.json` exists on the runner, passing this flag will make the orchestrator attempt to run:
  `deploy/qcity/generate_runner_manifest.py --apply`
  to create a manifest. The generator is conservative and will write a JSON manifest describing the runner's discovered capabilities.
- --runner-id <id>
  When used together with `--manifest-write`, the supplied runner id will be passed to the generator and embedded in the generated manifest. This helps identify the runner in a fleet.

# @jridgewell/gen-mapping
> Generate source maps
`gen-mapping` allows you to generate a source map during transpilation or minification.
With a source map, you're able to trace the original location in the source file, either in Chrome's
DevTools or using a library like [`@jridgewell/trace-mapping`][trace-mapping].
You may already be familiar with the [`source-map`][source-map] package's `SourceMapGenerator`. This
provides the same `addMapping` and `setSourceContent` API.

``
# @jridgewell/remapping
> Remap sequential sourcemaps through transformations to point at the original source code
Remapping allows you to take the sourcemaps generated through transforming your code and "remap"
them to the original source locations. Think "my minified code, transformed with babel and bundled
with webpack", all pointing to the correct location in your original source code.
With remapping, none of your source code transformations need to be aware of the input's sourcemap,
they only need to generate an output sourcemap. This greatly simplifies building custom
transformations (think a find-and-replace).

## qmoi-enhanced/qmoi-enhanced/dashboard/node_modules/@jridgewell/sourcemap-codec/README.md

``
# @jridgewell/sourcemap-codec
Encode/decode the `mappings` property of a [sourcemap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit).
## Why?
Sourcemaps are difficult to generate and manipulate, because the `mappings` property – the part that actually links the generated code back to the original source – is encoded using an obscure method called [Variable-length quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity). On top of that, each segment in the mapping contains offsets rather than absolute indices, which means that you can't look at a segment in isolation – you have to understand the whole sourcemap.
This package makes the process slightly easier.
## Installation
```bash
npm install @jridgewell/sourcemap-codec

## qmoi-enhanced/qmoi-enhanced/dashboard/node_modules/@jridgewell/trace-mapping/README.md

# @jridgewell/trace-mapping
> Trace the original position through a source map
`trace-mapping` allows you to take the line and column of an output file and trace it to the
original location in the source file through a source map.
You may already be familiar with the [`source-map`][source-map] package's `SourceMapConsumer`. This
provides the same `originalPositionFor` and `generatedPositionFor` API, without requiring WASM.

`baseline-browser-mapping` provides:
- An `Array` of browsers compatible with Baseline Widely available and Baseline year feature sets via the [`getCompatibleVersions()` function](#get-baseline-widely-available-browser-versions-or-baseline-year-browser-versions).
- An `Array`, `Object` or `CSV` as a string describing the Baseline feature set support of all browser versions included in the module's data set via the [`getAllVersions()` function](#get-data-for-all-browser-versions).
You can use `baseline-browser-mapping` to help you determine minimum browser version support for your chosen Baseline feature set; or to analyse the level of support for different Baseline feature sets in your site's traffic by joining the data with your analytics data.

``
### Version 4.0.0 (2018-01-28) ###
- Added: Support for ES2018. The only change needed was recognizing the `s`
  regex flag.
- Changed: _All_ tokens returned by the `matchToToken` function now have a
  `closed` property. It is set to `undefined` for the tokens where “closed”
  doesn’t make sense. This means that all tokens objects have the same shape,
  which might improve performance.

Given some data, _jsesc_ returns a stringified representation of that data. jsesc is similar to `JSON.stringify()` except:
1. it outputs JavaScript instead of JSON [by default](#json), enabling support for data structures like ES6 maps and sets;
2. it offers [many options](#api) to customize the output;
3. its output is ASCII-safe [by default](#minimal), thanks to its use of [escape sequences](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-escapes) where needed.
For any input, jsesc generates the shortest possible valid printable-ASCII-only output. [Here’s an online [PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED].](https://mothereff.in/js-escapes)
jsesc’s output can be used instead of `JSON.stringify`’s to avoid [mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake) and other encoding issues, or even to [avoid errors](https://twitter.com/annevk/status/380000829643571200) when passing JSON-formatted data (which may contain U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR, U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR, or [lone surrogates](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/code-points-vs-unicode-scalar-values#content-14)) to a JavaScript parser or an UTF-8 encoder.

# `react`
React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.
The `react` package contains only the functionality necessary to define React components. It is typically used together with a React renderer like `react-dom` for the web, or `react-native` for the native environments.
**Note:** by default, React will be in development mode. The development version includes extra warnings about common mistakes, whereas the production version includes extra performance optimizations and strips all error messages. Don't forget to use the [production build](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build) when deploying your application.
## Usage

import { useState } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

# `scheduler`
This is a package for cooperative scheduling in a browser environment. It is currently used internally by React, but we plan to make it more generic.
The public API for this package is not yet finalized.
### Thanks
The React team thanks [Anton Podviaznikov](https://podviaznikov.com/) for donating the `scheduler` package name.

# Source Map JS
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/source-map-js.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-js)
Difference between original [source-map](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map):
> TL,DR: it's fork of original source-map@0.6, but with perfomance optimizations.
This journey starts from [source-map@0.7.0](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#070). Some part of it was rewritten to Rust and WASM and API became async.
It's still a major block for many libraries like PostCSS or Sass for example because they need to migrate the whole API to the async way. This is the reason why 0.6.1 has 2x more downloads than 0.7.3 while it's faster several times.
![Downloads count](media/downloads.png)
More important that WASM version has some optimizations in JS code too. This is why [community asked to create branch for 0.6 version](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/issues/324) and port these optimizations but, sadly, the answer was «no». A bit later I discovered [the issue](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map/issues/370) created by [Ben Rothman (@benthemonkey)](https://github.com/benthemonkey) with no response at all.

[![monthly downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/tinyglobby.svg?maxAge=3600)](https://npmjs.com/package/tinyglobby)
A fast and minimal alternative to globby and fast-glob, meant to behave the same way.
Both globby and fast-glob present some behavior no other globbing lib has,
which makes it hard to manually replace with something smaller and better.
This library uses only two subdependencies, compared to `globby`'s [23](https://npmgraph.js.org/?q=globby@14.1.0)
and `fast-glob`'s [17](https://npmgraph.js.org/?q=fast-glob@3.3.3).

# QMOI GitHub Actions Self-Healing CI/CD Automation
## Overview
QMOI now supports self-healing automation for GitHub Actions workflows. The system can:
- Fetch the latest failed workflow run via the GitHub API

# QMOI GitLab Self-Healing CI/CD Automation
## Overview
QMOI now includes a self-healing automation script for GitLab CI/CD. This script automatically detects and fixes common errors in `.gitlab-ci.yml` (such as typos in script paths), commits the fix, pushes it, and triggers a new pipeline. All actions are logged for audit and debugging.
## How It Works
- On pipeline failure, the script fetches the latest failed job log using the GitLab API.
- It scans for common errors (e.g., `No such file or directory`, `command not found`).
- If a typo in a file path is detected, it uses fuzzy matching to suggest and apply the correct path.
- The script patches `.gitlab-ci.yml`, commits, pushes, and triggers a new pipeline.

# Troubleshooting Guide
## PowerShell Display Issues
### PSReadLine Errors
- If you see errors like `Actual value was 1. at System.Console.SetCursorPosition`, this is a known PowerShell/Windows issue with long output or commit messages.
- **Workarounds:**
  - Use shorter commit messages, or use `git commit -F message.txt` to commit with a file.
  - Use Git Bash or WSL for a more robust terminal experience.
  - Upgrade PowerShell and PSReadLine to the latest version.

# @hapi/hoek
#### Utility methods for the hapi ecosystem.
**hoek** is part of the **hapi** ecosystem and was designed to work seamlessly with the [hapi web framework](https://hapi.dev) and its other components (but works great on its own or with other frameworks). If you are using a different web framework and find this module useful, check out [hapi](https://hapi.dev) – they work even better together.
This module is not intended to solve every problem for everyone, but rather as a central place to store hapi-specific methods. If you're looking for a general purpose utility module, check out [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash).

## qmoi-enhanced/qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/@jridgewell/gen-mapping/README.md

``
# @jridgewell/gen-mapping
> Generate source maps
`gen-mapping` allows you to generate a source map during transpilation or minification.
With a source map, you're able to trace the original location in the source file, either in Chrome's
DevTools or using a library like [`@jridgewell/trace-mapping`][trace-mapping].
You may already be familiar with the [`source-map`][source-map] package's `SourceMapGenerator`. This
provides the same `addMapping` and `setSourceContent` API.
## Installation

## qmoi-enhanced/qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/@jridgewell/remapping/README.md

``
# @jridgewell/remapping
> Remap sequential sourcemaps through transformations to point at the original source code
Remapping allows you to take the sourcemaps generated through transforming your code and "remap"
them to the original source locations. Think "my minified code, transformed with babel and bundled
with webpack", all pointing to the correct location in your original source code.
With remapping, none of your source code transformations need to be aware of the input's sourcemap,
they only need to generate an output sourcemap. This greatly simplifies building custom
transformations (think a find-and-replace).

## qmoi-enhanced/qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/@jridgewell/sourcemap-codec/README.md

``
# @jridgewell/sourcemap-codec
Encode/decode the `mappings` property of a [sourcemap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit).
## Why?
Sourcemaps are difficult to generate and manipulate, because the `mappings` property – the part that actually links the generated code back to the original source – is encoded using an obscure method called [Variable-length quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity). On top of that, each segment in the mapping contains offsets rather than absolute indices, which means that you can't look at a segment in isolation – you have to understand the whole sourcemap.
This package makes the process slightly easier.
## Installation
```bash
npm install @jridgewell/sourcemap-codec
``

## qmoi-enhanced/qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/@jridgewell/trace-mapping/README.md

# @jridgewell/trace-mapping
> Trace the original position through a source map
`trace-mapping` allows you to take the line and column of an output file and trace it to the
original location in the source file through a source map.
You may already be familiar with the [`source-map`][source-map] package's `SourceMapConsumer`. This
provides the same `originalPositionFor` and `generatedPositionFor` API, without requiring WASM.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/nodeca/argparse.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/nodeca/argparse)
[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/argparse.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/argparse)
CLI arguments parser for node.js, with [sub-commands](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/argparse.html#sub-commands) support. Port of python's [argparse](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html) (version [3.9.0](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.9.0rc1/Lib/argparse.py)).
**Difference with original.**
- JS has no keyword arguments support.
  -  Pass options instead: `new ArgumentParser({ description: 'example', add_help: true })`.

# cosmiconfig
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/cosmiconfig/cosmiconfig/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/cosmiconfig/cosmiconfig)
Cosmiconfig searches for and loads configuration for your program.
It features smart defaults based on conventional expectations in the JavaScript ecosystem.
But it's also flexible enough to search wherever you'd like to search, and load whatever you'd like to load.
By default, Cosmiconfig will check the current directory for the following:
- a `package.json` property
- a JSON or YAML, extensionless "rc file"

``
# open
> Open stuff like URLs, files, executables. Cross-platform.
If need this for Electron, use [`shell.openItem()`](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/shell#shellopenitemfullpath) instead.
Note: The original [`open` package](https://github.com/pwnall/node-open) was recently deprecated in favor of this package, and we got the name, so this package is now named `open` instead of `opn`. If you're upgrading from the original `open` package (`open@0.0.5` or lower), keep in mind that the API is different.
#### Why?
- Actively maintained.
- Supports app arguments.
- Safer as it uses `spawn` instead of `exec`.

JavaScript implementation of the timer APIs; `setTimeout`, `clearTimeout`, `setImmediate`, `clearImmediate`, `setInterval`, `clearInterval`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `cancelAnimationFrame`, `requestIdleCallback`, and `cancelIdleCallback`, along with a clock instance that controls the flow of time. [PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]Timers also provides a `Date` implementation that gets its time from the clock.
In addition in browser environment `@sinonjs/[PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]-timers` provides a `performance` implementation that gets its time from the clock. In Node environments [PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]Timers provides a `nextTick` implementation that is synchronized with the clock - and a `process.hrtime` shim that works with the clock.
`@sinonjs/[PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]-timers` can be used to simulate passing time in automated tests and other
situations where you want the scheduling semantics, but don't want to actually
wait.

# [`baseline-browser-mapping`](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/packages/baseline-browser-mapping)
By the [W3C WebDX Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/) and contributors.
`baseline-browser-mapping` provides:
- An `Array` of browsers compatible with Baseline Widely available and Baseline year feature sets via the [`getCompatibleVersions()` function](#get-baseline-widely-available-browser-versions-or-baseline-year-browser-versions).
- An `Array`, `Object` or `CSV` as a string describing the Baseline feature set support of all browser versions included in the module's data set via the [`getAllVersions()` function](#get-data-for-all-browser-versions).
You can use `baseline-browser-mapping` to help you determine minimum browser version support for your chosen Baseline feature set; or to analyse the level of support for different Baseline feature sets in your site's traffic by joining the data with your analytics data.

# bl *(BufferList)*
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/rvagg/bl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rvagg/bl/)
**A Node.js Buffer list collector, reader and streamer thingy.**
[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/bl.svg)](https://nodei.co/npm/bl/)
**bl** is a storage object for collections of Node Buffers, exposing them with the main Buffer readable API. Also works as a duplex stream so you can collect buffers from a stream that emits them and emit buffers to a stream that consumes them!
The original buffers are kept intact and copies are only done as necessary. Any reads that require the use of a single original buffer will return a slice of that buffer only (which references the same memory as the original buffer). Reads that span buffers perform concatenation as required and return the results transparently.
```js
const { BufferList } = require('bl')

# BSER Binary Serialization
BSER is a binary serialization scheme that can be used as an alternative to JSON.
BSER uses a framed encoding that makes it simpler to use to stream a sequence of
encoded values.
It is intended to be used for local-IPC only and strings are represented as binary
with no specific encoding; this matches the convention employed by most operating
system filename storage.
For more details about the serialization scheme see

# Chrome Flags for Tooling
Many tools maintain a list of runtime flags for Chrome to configure the environment. This file
is an attempt to document all chrome flags that are relevant to tools, automation, benchmarking, etc.
All use cases are different, so you'll have to choose which flags are most appropriate.
Here's a **[Nov 2022 comparison of what flags](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n-vw_PCPS45jX3Jt9jQaAhFqBY6Ge1vWF_Pa0k7dCk4/edit#gid=1265672696)**  all these [tools](#sources) use.
## Commonly unwanted browser features
* `--disable-client-side-phishing-detection`: Disables client-side phishing detection
* `--disable-component-extensions-with-background-pages`: Disable some built-in extensions that aren't affected by `--disable-extensions`

var convert = require('color-convert');
convert.rgb.hsl(140, 200, 100);             // [96, 48, 59]
convert.keyword.rgb('blue');                // [0, 0, 255]

> A tiny (183B to 210B) and [fast](#benchmarks) utility to ascend parent directories
With [escalade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalade), you can scale parent directories until you've found what you're looking for.<br>Given an input file or directory, `escalade` will continue executing your callback function until either:
1) the callback returns a truthy value
2) `escalade` has reached the system root directory (eg, `/`)
> **Important:**<br>Please note that `escalade` only deals with direct ancestry – it will not dive into parents' sibling directories.
---
**Notice:** As of v3.1.0, `escalade` now includes [Deno support](http://deno.land/x/escalade)! Please see [Deno Usage](#deno) below.

=================
`fs-extra` adds file system methods that aren't included in the native `fs` module and adds promise support to the `fs` methods. It also uses [`graceful-fs`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-graceful-fs) to prevent `EMFILE` errors. It should be a drop in replacement for `fs`.

# fs.realpath
A backwards-compatible fs.realpath for Node v6 and above
In Node v6, the JavaScript implementation of fs.realpath was replaced
with a faster (but less resilient) native implementation.  That raises
new and platform-specific errors and cannot handle long or excessively
symlink-looping paths.
This module handles those cases by detecting the new errors and
falling back to the JavaScript implementation.  On versions of Node

# gensync
This module allows for developers to write common code that can share
implementation details, hiding whether an underlying request happens
synchronously or asynchronously. This is in contrast with many current Node
APIs which explicitly implement the same API twice, once with calls to
synchronous functions, and once with asynchronous functions.
Take for example `fs.readFile` and `fs.readFileSync`, if you're writing an API
that loads a file and then performs a synchronous operation on the data, it

# hermes-parser
A JavaScript parser built from the Hermes engine's parser compiled to WebAssembly. Can parse ES6, Flow, and JSX syntax.
## API
The Hermes parser exposes a single `parse(code, [options])` function, where `code` is the source code to parse as a string, and `options` is an optional object that may contain the following properties:
- **babel**: `boolean`, defaults to `false`. If `true`, output an AST conforming to Babel's AST format. If `false`, output an AST conforming to the ESTree AST format.
- **allowReturnOutsideFunction**: `boolean`, defaults to `false`. If `true`, do not error on return statements found outside functions.
- **flow**: `"all"` or `"detect"`, defaults to `"detect"`. If `"detect"`, only parse syntax as Flow syntax where it is ambiguous whether it is a Flow feature or regular JavaScript when the `@flow` pragma is present in the file. Otherwise if `"all"`, always parse ambiguous syntax as Flow syntax regardless of the presence of an `@flow` pragma. For example `foo<T>(x)` in a file without an `@flow` pragma will be parsed as two comparisons if set to `"detect"`, otherwise if set to `"all"` or the `@flow` pragma is included it will be parsed as a call expression with a type argument.
- **sourceFilename**: `string`, defaults to `null`. The filename corresponding to the code that is to be parsed. If non-null, the filename will be added to all source locations in the output AST.

iMurmurHash.js
==============
An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).
This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.
Installation
------------
To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

# `@jest/utils`

## `ErrorWithStack`
This custom error class can be useful when you need to capture the stack trace of an error and provide additional context to the error message. By default, JavaScript errors only capture the stack trace when they are thrown, but this class allows you to capture the stack trace at any point in your code by calling its constructor.
## `clearLine`
It ensures that the clearing operation is only performed when running in a terminal environment, and not when the output is redirected to a file or another non-terminal destination.
## `convertDescriptorToString`
It defines a function named `convertDescriptorToString` that takes a descriptor as input and converts it to a string based on its type. It handles various types such as functions, numbers, strings, and undefined values. If the input doesn't match any of these types, it throws an error with a descriptive message.

## qmoi-enhanced/qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/jest-worker/README.md

``
# jest-worker
Module for executing heavy tasks under forked processes in parallel, by providing a `Promise` based interface, minimum overhead, and bound workers.
The module works by providing an absolute path of the module to be loaded in all forked processes. All methods are exposed on the parent process as promises, so they can be `await`'ed. Child (worker) methods can either be synchronous or asynchronous.
The module also implements support for bound workers. Binding a worker means that, based on certain parameters, the same task will always be executed by the same worker. The way bound workers work is by using the returned string of the `computeWorkerKey` method. If the string was used before for a task, the call will be queued to the related worker that processed the task earlier; if not, it will be executed by the first available worker, then sticked to the worker that executed it; so the next time it will be processed by the same worker. If you have no preference on the worker executing the task, but you have defined a `computeWorkerKey` method because you want _some_ of the tasks to be sticked, you can return `null` from it.
The list of exposed methods can be explicitly provided via the `exposedMethods` option. If it is not provided, it will be obtained by requiring the child module into the main process, and analyzed via reflection. Check the "minimal example" section for a valid one.
## Install
```sh
yarn add jest-worker

  `closed` property. It is set to `undefined` for the tokens where “closed”
  doesn’t make sense. This means that all tokens objects have the same shape,
  which might improve performance.

JavaScriptCore santizes source URLs in error stacks by stripping query strings and fragments. Ref: [`Webkit/Webkit#49109d`](https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/commit/49109db4ab87a715f7a8987c7ee380e63060298b).
This package contains utility functions required to implement the proposed [React Native Community RFC0646](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/pull/646). It exports three functons:
## `function isJscSafeUrl(url: string): boolean`
Returns `false` if the URL has a query component that could be stripped by JSC.
## `function toJscSafeUrl(urlToConvert: string): string`
Accepts an absolute or relative URL, and encodes any data in the input query string (if present) into the [path component](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.3) of the URL, by using the delimiter `//&` (which cannot appear in a normalized file path) to separate the original path from the orignal query string.

## qmoi-enhanced/qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/jsesc/README.md

``
# jsesc
Given some data, _jsesc_ returns a stringified representation of that data. jsesc is similar to `JSON.stringify()` except:
1. it outputs JavaScript instead of JSON [by default](#json), enabling support for data structures like ES6 maps and sets;
2. it offers [many options](#api) to customize the output;
3. its output is ASCII-safe [by default](#minimal), thanks to its use of [escape sequences](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-escapes) where needed.
For any input, jsesc generates the shortest possible valid printable-ASCII-only output. [Here’s an online [PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED].](https://mothereff.in/js-escapes)
jsesc’s output can be used instead of `JSON.stringify`’s to avoid [mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake) and other encoding issues, or even to [avoid errors](https://twitter.com/annevk/status/380000829643571200) when passing JSON-formatted data (which may contain U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR, U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR, or [lone surrogates](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/code-points-vs-unicode-scalar-values#content-14)) to a JavaScript parser or an UTF-8 encoder.

# Metro
🚇 The JavaScript bundler for React Native.
- **🚅 Fast**: We aim for sub-second reload cycles, fast startup and quick bundling speeds.
- **⚖️ Scalable**: Works with thousands of modules in a single application.
- **⚛️ Integrated**: Supports every React Native project out of the box.
This project was previously part of the [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) repository. In this smaller repository it is easier for the team working on Metro to respond to both issues and pull requests. See [react-native#13976](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/13976) for the initial announcement.

``
# hermes-parser
A JavaScript parser built from the Hermes engine's parser compiled to WebAssembly. Can parse ES6, Flow, and JSX syntax.
## API
The Hermes parser exposes a single `parse(code, [options])` function, where `code` is the source code to parse as a string, and `options` is an optional object that may contain the following properties:
- **babel**: `boolean`, defaults to `false`. If `true`, output an AST conforming to Babel's AST format. If `false`, output an AST conforming to the ESTree AST format.
- **allowReturnOutsideFunction**: `boolean`, defaults to `false`. If `true`, do not error on return statements found outside functions.
- **flow**: `"all"` or `"detect"`, defaults to `"detect"`. If `"detect"`, only parse syntax as Flow syntax where it is ambiguous whether it is a Flow feature or regular JavaScript when the `@flow` pragma is present in the file. Otherwise if `"all"`, always parse ambiguous syntax as Flow syntax regardless of the presence of an `@flow` pragma. For example `foo<T>(x)` in a file without an `@flow` pragma will be parsed as two comparisons if set to `"detect"`, otherwise if set to `"all"` or the `@flow` pragma is included it will be parsed as a call expression with a type argument.
- **sourceFilename**: `string`, defaults to `null`. The filename corresponding to the code that is to be parsed. If non-null, the filename will be added to all source locations in the output AST.

# Changers Lorgs!
## 1.0
Full rewrite.  Essentially a brand new module.
- Return a promise instead of taking a callback.
- Use native `fs.mkdir(path, { recursive: true })` when available.
- Drop support for outdated Node.js versions.  (Technically still works on
  Node.js v8, but only 10 and above are officially supported.)

JavaScript Numbers are represented as [IEEE 754 double-precision floats](http://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/coding/ieeefloat.html).  Unfortunately, this means they lose integer precision for values beyond +/- 2^^53.  For projects that need to accurately handle 64-bit ints, such as [node-thrift](https://github.com/wadey/node-thrift), a performant, Number-like class is needed.  Int64 is that class.
Int64 instances look and feel much like JS-native Numbers.  By way of example ...
```js
// First, let's illustrate the problem ...
> (0x123456789).toString(16)
'123456789' // <- what we expect.
> (0x123456789abcdef0).toString(16)
'123456789abcdf00' // <- Ugh!  JS doesn't do big ints. :(

This is meant to be used in command-line tools and scripts, not in the browser.
If you need this for Electron, use [`shell.openPath()`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/shell#shellopenpathpath) instead.
Note: The original [`open` package](https://github.com/pwnall/node-open) was previously deprecated in favor of this package, and we got the name, so this package is now named `open` instead of `opn`. If you're upgrading from the original `open` package (`open@0.0.5` or lower), keep in mind that the API is different.
#### Why?
- Actively maintained.
- Supports app arguments.

> Check if a path exists
NOTE: `fs.existsSync` has been un-deprecated in Node.js since 6.8.0. If you only need to check synchronously, this module is not needed.
While [`fs.exists()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_exists_path_callback) is being [deprecated](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/103), there's still a genuine use-case of being able to check if a path exists for other purposes than doing IO with it.
Never use this before handling a file though:
> In particular, checking if a file exists before opening it is an anti-pattern that leaves you vulnerable to race conditions: another process may remove the file between the calls to `fs.exists()` and `fs.open()`. Just open the file and handle the error when it's not there.

This is a simple implementation of Promises.  It is a super set of ES6 Promises designed to have readable, performant code and to provide just the extensions that are absolutely necessary for using promises today.
For detailed tutorials on its use, see www.promisejs.org
**N.B.** This promise exposes internals via underscore (`_`) prefixed properties.  If you use these, your code will break with each new release.

## qmoi-enhanced/qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/react/README.md

# `react`
React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.
The `react` package contains only the functionality necessary to define React components. It is typically used together with a React renderer like `react-dom` for the web, or `react-native` for the native environments.
**Note:** by default, React will be in development mode. The development version includes extra warnings about common mistakes, whereas the production version includes extra performance optimizations and strips all error messages. Don't forget to use the [production build](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build) when deploying your application.
## Usage
```js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
``

## qmoi-enhanced/qmoi-enhanced/mobile/node_modules/react-devtools-core/README.md

``
# `react-devtools-core`
This package provides low-level APIs to support renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). If you're looking for the standalone React DevTools UI, **we suggest using [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) instead of using this package directly**.
This package provides two entrypoints: labeled "backend" and "standalone" (frontend). Both APIs are described below.
# Backend API
Backend APIs are embedded in _development_ builds of renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) in order to connect to the React DevTools UI.
### Example
If you are building a non-browser-based React renderer, you can use the backend API like so:

# React & React Native Versions
This page describes how React and React Native versions interact each other.
The version alignment between the two frameworks relies on two synchronization points:
1. The versions in the `package.json` of the new app template. For example [for React Native 0.68.1](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.68-stable/template/package.json#L12-L15) the versions are aligned as follows:
```

# react-native-biometrics
React native biometrics is a simple bridge to native iOS and Android keystore management.  It allows you to create public private key pairs that are stored in native keystores and protected by biometric authentication.  Those keys can then be retrieved later, after proper authentication, and used to create a cryptographic signature.

# react-refresh
This package implements the wiring necessary to integrate Fast Refresh into bundlers. Fast Refresh is a feature that lets you edit React components in a running application without losing their state. It is similar to an old feature known as "hot reloading", but Fast Refresh is more reliable and officially supported by React.
This package is primarily aimed at developers of bundler plugins. If you’re working on one, here is a [rough guide](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16604#issuecomment-528663101) for Fast Refresh integration using this package.

# Source Map Support
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/evanw/node-source-map-support.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/evanw/node-source-map-support)
This module provides source map support for stack traces in node via the [V8 stack trace API](https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Stack-Trace-API). It uses the [source-map](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map) module to replace the paths and line numbers of source-mapped files with their original paths and line numbers. The output mimics node's stack trace format with the goal of making every compile-to-JS language more of a first-class citizen. Source maps are completely general (not specific to any one language) so you can use source maps with multiple compile-to-JS languages in the same node process.
## Installation and Usage
#### Node support
```
$ npm install source-map-support
```

# sprintf.js
**sprintf.js** is a complete open source JavaScript sprintf implementation for the *browser* and *node.js*.
Its prototype is simple:
    string sprintf(string format , [mixed arg1 [, mixed arg2 [ ,...]]])
The [PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]s in the format string are marked by `%` and are followed by one or more of these elements, in this order:
* An optional number followed by a `$` sign that selects which argument index to use for the value. If not specified, arguments will be placed in the same order as the [PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED]s in the input string.
* An optional `+` sign that forces to preceed the result with a plus or minus sign on numeric values. By default, only the `-` sign is used on negative numbers.
* An optional padding specifier that says what character to use for padding (if specified). Possible values are `0` or any other character precedeed by a `'` (single quote). The default is to pad with *spaces*.

# vlq.js
Convert integers to a Base64-encoded VLQ string, and vice versa. No dependencies, works in node.js or browsers, supports AMD.
## Why would you want to do that?
Sourcemaps are the most likely use case. Mappings from original source to generated content are encoded as a sequence of VLQ strings.
## What is a VLQ string?
A [variable-length quantity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-length_quantity) is a compact way of encoding large integers in text (i.e. in situations where you can't transmit raw binary data). An integer represented as digits will always take up more space than the equivalent VLQ representation:
| Integer             | VLQ        |

> Tiny queue data structure
You should use this package instead of an array if you do a lot of `Array#push()` and `Array#shift()` on large arrays, since `Array#shift()` has [linear time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(N)%E2%80%94Linear%20Time) *O(n)* while `Queue#dequeue()` has [constant time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(1)%20%E2%80%94%20Constant%20Time) *O(1)*. That makes a huge difference for large arrays.
> A [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is an ordered list of elements where an element is inserted at the end of the queue and is removed from the front of the queue. A queue works based on the first-in, first-out ([FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))) principle.
