# QMOI Model: Quantum Multi-Objective Intelligence

## Overview
QMOI (Quantum Multi-Objective Intelligence) is an advanced, local-first AI model and master system for multi-user, multi-project, and multi-session analytics, enhancement, and automation. It powers the Qi (Quantum Intelligence) master panel and backend, providing:

- **AI Task Logging**: Tracks all master/AI actions, enhancements, file uploads, and system events.
- **Enhancement Engine**: Supports manual and autonomous enhancements, with background suggestions and auto-improvements.
- **File Upload & Analysis**: Handles all file types, logs uploads, and enables AI-driven analysis and updates.
- **Multi-User/Project Analytics**: Aggregates stats across users, projects, and sessions for deep insight.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Calculates win/loss rates, streaks, best/worst trades, average durations, file type breakdowns, and more.
- **Export & Controls**: Masters can export all data (CSV/JSON), clear logs, trigger enhancements, and download full analytics.
- **Security**: All actions require master authentication and are logged for audit.
