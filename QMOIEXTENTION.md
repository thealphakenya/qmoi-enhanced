# QMOI Extension: Universal AI Agent for All Workspaces

## Always-On, Independent, Error-Resilient
- QMOI Extension is always ready and runs independently, even if there are errors in its own files or the host application.
- It does not depend on any other files or parts—runs standalone, directly using the QMOI model and memory.
- QMOI Extension auto-recovers, self-heals, and continues to operate even in degraded environments.

## Direct QMOI Model & Memory
- Uses QMOI's own model and memory directly—no external dependencies.
- Memory is always in sync with QMOI chat, apps, QCity, QMOI Space, QMOI AI, all accessible emails (e.g., rovicviccy@gmail.com), social media, and all platforms.
- QMOI Extension auto-syncs, auto-backs up, and auto-updates memory in real time.

## Revenue Generation, Employment, and Payment (10+ Methods)
QMOI Extension can make money, generate revenue, and manage employment/payments in at least 10 ways:
1. Automated SaaS subscriptions (monthly/annual)
2. In-app purchases and microtransactions
3. Affiliate marketing and referral programs
4. Ad placements (contextual, native, video, etc.)
5. Licensing QMOI tech to other platforms
6. Selling premium AI features or plugins
7. Automated consulting and code review services
8. Marketplace for QMOI-powered automations/scripts
9. Employment management (hiring, payroll, gig tasks)
10. Payment processing for digital goods/services
11. Crowdfunding and donations
12. Data analysis and reporting services
13. Automated trading and investment bots
14. Platform integration fees
15. Revenue sharing with partner apps
- QMOI always aims to increase daily revenue (target: $4000+/day, always growing).
- Understands and manages all currencies, auto-converts, and optimizes for best returns.

## UI, Graphs, and Master/Sister-Only Access
- All revenue, automation, employment, and money-making features are shown in real-time, auto-updating graphs (permanent, accurate, time-stamped, and auto-backed up).
- Only master and sister (or those master allows) can access these features and data.
- QMOI Extension is wise: it evades/escapes questions or actions not meant for master/sister, and never exposes sensitive features to others.

## README & Autorelease
- QMOI Extension is always highlighted in the main README, with icon, features, and usage.
- Autorelease: QMOI auto-publishes new versions, updates icons/appearance, and ensures the extension is always up-to-date and visually appealing.
- Icon and UI are enhanced for visibility, branding, and user experience (floating, animated, themed, etc.).

## Marketing & Platform Reach
- QMOI Extension is marketed across all major platforms, social media, and app stores.
- QMOI auto-optimizes marketing to maximize reach and revenue, always seeking new opportunities.

## Downloadable & Universal
- QMOI Extension can be downloaded/installed in any browser, IDE, or platform.
- All features and experiences are consistent with QMOI's chat interface, apps, and platforms.
