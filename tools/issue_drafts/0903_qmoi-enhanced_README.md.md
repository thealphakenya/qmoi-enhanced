# Review needed: qmoi-enhanced/README.md

Status: AUTOMATED_REMOVAL_FROM_DONEREFS

Suggested next steps:

- Inspect the file and its placeholder markers or TODOs.
- If the file is safe for production, remove the placeholder and add tests / small PR.
- If the file is intentionally non-production (e.g. simulated or cache), consider moving it out of the repo or documenting its purpose.
- After changes, re-run `scripts/verify_and_finalize_done.py` to include the file back in `donerefs.txt`.

# QMOI System

![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/QMOI%20Build-Passing-brightgreen?style=flat-square)

Welcome to the **Quantum Master Orchestrator Intelligence (QMOI)** system — a unified build, automation, deployment, and update pipeline for **QMOI AI** and all **QCity-powered apps** across every platform and device.

---

## 🚀 Build & Automation

Use the following tools to automate and build your apps:

| Tool                                 | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `python scripts/qmoi-app-builder.py` | Full cloud-based build and test for all devices                  |
| `build_qmoi_ai.bat`                  | Quick-build for Windows `.exe` using PyInstaller + GitHub deploy |
| `qmoiexe.py`                         | All-in-one launcher (backend + GUI + tray + updater + shortcuts) |
| `auto_updater.py`                    | Auto-checks GitHub for new releases and updates locally          |

> 🚗 All builds are **cloud-offloaded** to reduce load and ensure stability across devices.
