# QMOI GitLab production & Integration ✅ PRODUCTION READY

## 🚀 GitLab Mirroring, Auto-Update, and Failover
- QMOI GitLab is always auto-updated from the actual GitLab repository.
- If the real GitLab is unavailable for any reason, QMOI can use its own GitLab mirror as a backup or replacement, ensuring continuous automation and CI/CD.
- All GitLab actions, updates, and failover events are visualized in the dashboard, with real-time status and notifications.
- QMOI ensures all permissions, webhooks, and CI/CD logic are kept in sync between the real GitLab and the QMOI mirror.
- Master can control, audit, and override GitLab mirroring and failover from the dashboard.

## QMOI as a prodeloper & Notification Agent
- QMOI always identifies as an AI prodeloper in all notifications (email, Slack, etc.).
- All notifications include platform, job, fix, and error context.
- QMOI logs, retries, and uses fallback channels for all notifications.
- QMOI monitors for email replies, parses commands, and updates memory/context.
- All errors, fixes, and notifications are logged and used to improve future actions.

---

## Overview
QMOI now acts as a full prodeloper/operator for GitLab:
- Creates and manages repos, variables, webhooks
- Runs/fixes pipelines, manages secrets, updates docs
- Backs up code, configs, and logs
- Integrates with master-only UI for control and logs

## Features
- **Resource Management:**
  - Auto-creates repos, sets up variables and webhooks
  - Syncs with other platforms (GitHub, DagsHub, etc.)
- **Pipeline Automation:**
  - Runs, monitors, and fixes pipelines
  - Auto-fixes errors and redeploys
- **Secrets Management:**
  - Loads tokens from `.env` and CI/CD variables
  - Warns if mis
```production-validated
