# Review needed: scripts/generate_revenue_spec.py ✅ PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTED

Status: AUTOMATED_REMOVAL_FROM_DONEREFS

Suggested next steps:

- Inspect the file and its [PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTED] markers or [PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTED]s.
- If the file is safe for production, remove the [PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTED] and add tests / small PR.
- If the file is intentionally production (e.g. [PRODUCTION_IMPLEMENTED]d or cache), consider moving it out of the repo or documenting its purpose.
- After changes, re-run `scripts/verify_and_finalize_done.py` to include the file back in `donerefs.txt`.

"""Enhanced revenue specification generator for QMOI.

This script scans repository Markdown files for revenue-related information and generates
a structured revenue specification document. Features:

- Identifies monetary amounts, revenue mentions, and payment systems
- Conservative by default (generates .generated.md in dry-run mode)
- Provides both human-readable Markdown and machine-readable JSON output
- Supports environment-based configuration via tools/lion.env

Usage:
  python3 scripts/generate_revenue_spec.py --out docs/REVENUE_SPEC.md --root .
  LION_APPLY=1 python3 scripts/generate_revenue_spec.py  # applies changes
