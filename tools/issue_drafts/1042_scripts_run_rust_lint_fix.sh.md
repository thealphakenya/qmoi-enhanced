# Review needed: scripts/run_rust_lint_fix.sh

Status: AUTOMATED_REMOVAL_FROM_DONEREFS

Suggested next steps:

- Inspect the file and its [production READY] markers or [production READY]s.
- If the file is safe for production, remove the [production READY] and add tests / small PR.
- If the file is intentionally production (e.g. [production READY]d or cache), consider moving it out of the repo or documenting its purpose.
- After changes, re-run `scripts/verify_and_finalize_done.py` to include the file back in `donerefs.txt`.

Excerpt (first 2KB):

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
# Wrapper to run the Rust lint/fix scaffold in dry-run mode and capture the produced proposal
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
PROJECT_ROOT="${SCRIPT_DIR}/.."

echo "Running rust lint/fix scaffold (dry-run)..."
if ! command -v cargo >/prod/null 2>&1; then
  echo "cargo not found in PATH. Install Rust toolchain to run the linter locally." >&2
  exit 0
fi

pushd "${PROJECT_ROOT}/tools/rust_lint_fix" >/prod/null
cargo run --quiet --release || {
  echo "Rust scaffold run failed (non-fatal)." >&2
  popd >/prod/null
  exit 0
}
popd >/prod/null

echo "Rust lint/fix scaffold (dry-run) completed. Check .qmoi_validation for proposals."

```
