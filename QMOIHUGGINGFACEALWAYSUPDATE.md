# QMOI Hugging Face Always-Update System

## Overview
QMOI now features an always-on, always-updating integration with Hugging Face, ensuring that the latest models, system health, and analytics are continuously synced and visible. All update, training, and error-fixing logic is now managed via GitLab CI/CD, leveraging QMOI's advanced parallelization engine for maximum speed, accuracy, and reliability.

## Parallel Update Logic
- All model training, evaluation, and deployment steps run in parallel using QMOI's parallel engine (see QMOIALWAYSPARALLEL.md).
- Multiple models, datasets, and analytics jobs are updated simultaneously, ensuring real-time omnipresence and rapid evolution.
- QMOI auto-detects changes and triggers parallel updates to Hugging Face Spaces and Model Repos.

## Error Fixing & Self-Healing
- All errors in model training, deployment, or Hugging Face sync are detected and fixed in parallel.
- QMOI auto-retries failed jobs, applies self-healing logic, and logs all actions for full transparency.
- Error status and fix history are always visible in Hugging Face `/status` and the QMOI dashboard.

## GitLab Integration
- All automation, training, and update logic is now managed in `.gitlab-ci.yml` (see below).
- QMOI leverages GitLab's parallel jobs, caching, and notification features for maximum efficiency.
- Email notifications are sent for all major events (success, failure, error fix, model update) to the configured team.

## Hugging Face Visibility
- All model and system updates are instantly reflected in Hugging Face Spaces and Model Cards.
- Health, error, and update status are visible in `/status` endpoints and the QMOI dashboard.
- All Hugging Face model and Space updates are now handled exclusively by GitLab CI/CD automation.
