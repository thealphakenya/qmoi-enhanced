always remember to refer and update from allits .md files, @REFERENCES.md . i was at step three, you can check best plan to automate and enhance further for fixing all arrors successfully, also enhance all autotest eatures ,enhance for best performsnce and not to use anything of the device (e.g ram, storage and all others so that it would work like a very light size and very powerfull. Here’s a step-by-step plan to address your advanced requirements for QMOI’s automation, error fixing, high-quality site generation, and parallel money-making/revenue features:
Step 1: Enhance Error Auto-Fixing System
Universal Error Catching:
Expand error detection to cover all automation steps (site creation, deployment, provider integration, asset management, etc.).
Self-Healing & Retry Logic:
QMOI will automatically attempt multiple strategies to fix errors (e.g., retry, switch provider, roll back, auto-patch code/config).
Root Cause Analysis:
Integrate AI-driven diagnostics to identify and resolve root causes, not just symptoms.
Continuous Learning:
QMOI will learn from past errors and fixes, improving its auto-fix strategies over time.
Fast Notification & Logging:
All errors, fixes, and outcomes are logged and (optionally) notified to master.
Step 2: High-Quality Site Generation
Best-Practice Templates:
Use modern, responsive, SEO-optimized templates (React, Next.js, etc.) for all new sites.
Automated Quality Checks:
Run accessibility, performance, SEO, and security audits on every site before launch.
Auto-Enhancement:
QMOI will auto-improve sites based on audit results (e.g., fix accessibility, optimize images, improve SEO).
Content & Design AI:
Optionally use AI to generate high-quality content, images, and layouts.
Step 3: Money-Making Integration
Revenue-Driven Site Creation:
QMOI will auto-create sites for affiliate, e-commerce, SaaS, content, and other revenue streams.
Platform & Deal Discovery:
QMOI will scan for new platforms, deals, and monetization opportunities, auto-register, and deploy as needed.
Automated Marketing & Syndication:
Every site/project is auto-promoted across all relevant channels and platforms.
Revenue Tracking & Optimization:
QMOI will monitor all revenue streams, compare against targets, and auto-optimize for maximum earnings.Step 4: Enhanced Parallelization
Parallel Execution:
QMOI will run all money-making, site-building, error-fixing, and optimization tasks in parallel, scaling as needed.
Real-Time Progress & Health Dashboard:
Master can see all parallel activities, revenue status, error/fix status, and platform coverage in real time.
Fastest Path to Success:
QMOI will always choose the fastest, most reliable path to fix errors, launch projects, and hit revenue targets.Step 5: Documentation & UI
Update all relevant .md files and REFERENCES.md to document new error-fixing, site quality, and parallelization features.
Enhance master-only UI panels to show error/fix status, site quality, revenue progress, and parallel activity health.
Step 6: Implementation Plan
Refactor error auto-fixing logic for universal, self-healing, and learning capabilities.
Integrate high-quality site generation and automated audits/enhancements.
Expand money-making automation to leverage new site features and parallel execution.
Update documentation and UI references.
