- **Device Management**: Track, locate, and manage all user devices, including lost/stolen tracking and health checks.
- **Extension/Package Management**: AI can search, install, and manage extensions, packages, and datasets (runs in Colab/cloud for heavy tasks).
- **Large Data Handling**: Upload, download, and process very large files and datasets efficiently.
- **Self-Healing & Health Checks**: AI monitors and fixes app/device errors, can simulate virtual CPU/memory/GPU for performance.
- **Real-Time QI State**: Floating, animated window shows live AI/system state, memory, and health.
- **Security & Audit**: All actions require admin token, are logged, and device access is permissioned.

## Advanced Features
- **Colab/Cloud Integration**: Offload heavy computation, rendering, and data processing to Colab or cloud VMs. Includes real authentication and API calls to Google Colab or cloud VMs, with endpoints to install packages, upload datasets, and execute jobs in the cloud. Tracks job status and returns real results.
- **Dynamic Extension/Package Management**: AI auto-discovers, installs, and updates the latest packages using npm, PyPI, or other APIs. Includes logic for auto-upgrade, update checks, and logs all actions for real-time analytics.
- **Advanced File Generation & Internet Integration**: Integrates with APIs (HuggingFace, GitHub, npm, etc.) to fetch the latest resources, uses web scraping/RSS for new releases, and enables the AI to generate/manage files of any type/size. Documentation is auto-generated and updated for each package/extension/software, and all files are saved in project folders. Projects, docs, and packages are available in QI admin pages for download, deployment, and marketing.
- **AI-Initiated Projects & Creativity Engine**: The AI autonomously initiates, builds, tests, and manages at least 10 projects per day, with at least 1 project for each feature type (app, game, animation/movie, music/audio, art, etc.). AI varies project types, learns from results, and ensures all projects are tested and validated. For animation/movie, AI creates long-form content (minimum 1hr 20min), can generate series, and composes full movies with story, visuals, and audio. For music, AI can compose, produce, sing, and save music/audio files. All generated files are saved in dedicated project folders, and projects are automatically added to the admin projects list in QI pages. Download/export option is available for all projects.
- **Automated Documentation & Packaging**: For every package, extension, or software built, the AI generates and saves documentation and packaging files in the respective project folder. These are accessible, downloadable, and deployable from the QI admin interface, and can be marketed directly.
- **Frontend Enhancements**: Dataset management UI, advanced controls for file generation and health/self-healing, and improved device tracking for native mobile integration.
- **Performance, Security, and Extensibility**: Optimized backend for large data and concurrent jobs, hardened authentication and access controls, and modularized code for easy extension.
- **Tool Creation & Automation**: AI can autonomously create, test, and use new tools (utilities, scripts, plugins, APIs) both on its own and on user request. Tools are integrated into the platform and can be invoked by the AI for research, automation, or user workflows.
- **Ultra-Fast, Deep Research & Learning**: AI leverages advanced search, web APIs, and deep learning to research, analyze, and learn from vast data sources in real time. Results are accurate, up-to-date, and delivered with minimal latency.
- **AI Project Suggestions & Creative Decision-Making**: The AI proactively suggests new project ideas, tools, or creative directions based on user interests, trends, and its own learning. Users receive context-aware recommendations and can trigger instant project/tool creation.
- **Next-Level UX & Feedback**: The interface is further polished for clarity, speed, and delight. AI provides real-time feedback, progress, and creative insights, adapting the UI and suggestions to user behavior and project context.
- **Adaptive Creative/Decision Engine**: The AI continuously learns from user actions, project outcomes, and global trends to refine its suggestions, tool usage, and project generation. It adapts its creative strategies, prioritizes user-preferred domains, and surfaces the most relevant, innovative, and high-impact ideas in real time. The system offers smart nudges, context-aware prompts, and can auto-pilot creative workflows for rapid prototyping or deep research.
- **Real-Time Creative/Decision-Making**: The AI provides live, context-aware creative prompts, project/tool recommendations, and smart nudges as you work. It adapts suggestions in real time based on your actions, project progress, and global trends, helping you rapidly prototype, pivot, or deepen your work. Users can opt-in to auto-pilot mode for hands-free creative exploration, or receive instant feedback and next-step ideas as they interact with the platform.

## UX & Download Features
- **Project Download**: Users can download/export any project as a JSON or relevant file format directly from the UI.
- **Enhanced UX & Decision-Making**: AI provides polished, intuitive UI/UX, with creative and context-aware decision-making for project selection, progress, and feedback.

## Hooks & Utilities
- `useColabJob`: Manage Colab/cloud jobs and results.
- `useDeviceHealth`: Monitor device CPU, memory, battery, and online status.
- `useExtensionManager`: Search, install, and manage extensions/packages.
- `useLargeFileUpload`: Chunked upload/download for big files.
- `useAIHealthCheck`: Monitor and auto-fix app/AI issues.

## AI Accountability, Connectivity, and Enhanced Automation

### AI Accountability & Auditing
- **Admin Accountability**: The AI is fully accountable to the admin for all trading activities, WiFi connections, and user sessions. Every trade, WiFi connection/disconnection, and user session is logged with timestamps, context, and outcomes.
- **Session Reporting**: On request, the AI can provide a detailed report of all sessions it has had with any user, including actions taken, decisions made, and outcomes.
- **Trading Audit**: All trading activities (including automated and user-initiated trades) are logged and can be reviewed by the admin. The AI provides justifications, trade history, and performance analytics for every trade.

### Enhanced WiFi Auto-Connection & Instructions
- **Continuous Connectivity**: The AI automatically scans for all available WiFi networks (open and closed) and always prioritizes connecting the device to any available network to ensure uninterrupted internet access.
- **Data Savings**: The AI prefers WiFi over mobile data to help users save on data bundles, automatically switching to WiFi whenever possible.
- **Connection Instructions**: The AI can provide step-by-step instructions to join any WiFi network, including password prompts and troubleshooting tips.
- **Connection Logging**: All WiFi connection attempts, successes, and failures are logged and reportable to the admin.

### Enhanced Project Automation & Traceability
- **Project Traceability**: Every project created, modified, or managed by the AI is fully documented, with logs of all actions, decisions, and outcomes. The admin can review the full history and rationale for each project.
- **Automated Documentation**: The AI generates detailed documentation for each project, including creation steps, tools used, and testing results. This documentation is accessible and downloadable from the admin interface.
- **Accountable Automation**: All autonomous actions (project creation, tool usage, research, etc.) are logged and can be audited by the admin for transparency and compliance.
