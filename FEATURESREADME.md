## üß¨ Invention Projects (Admin/Sister Only)
- AI can create, manage, and auto-initiate invention projects for Victor Kwemoi and Leah Chebet.
- Invention projects support business, welfare, and national impact goals.
- All invention data and user credentials are encrypted and never exposed in exports or unzipped builds.

## üõ°Ô∏è Life Goals, Ambitions & AI Protector
- AI learns and assists with admin/sister life goals (protection, welfare, mental health, finances, security, business, inventions, leadership, philanthropy, etc.).
- QI dashboard has a secure, admin/sister-only section for viewing, adding, and editing these goals.
- AI proactively manages projects to help achieve these ambitions.
- All sensitive data is encrypted and access-controlled.

## üè† Local-First AI Protector Blueprint (Planned)
- Local deployment of vision/audio models (YOLO, OpenCV, whisper.cpp, etc.) for home/office protection.
- Sensor/camera/mic integration, anomaly detection, and local-only alert/response.
- Dashboard UI for live feeds, logs, device control, and explainable AI decisions.
- Full offline/edge operation, no cloud/API dependency.

üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Hooks & Utilities**
- `useColabJob`: Interface to execute, track, and manage jobs on Colab/cloud.
- `useDeviceHealth`: Check CPU, memory, battery, temperature, and online/offline state.
- `useExtensionManager`: Install, upgrade, and log extensions and packages.

- **Colab Trading Support**: The AI can offload trading simulations or batch trading jobs to Google Colab (or any cloud notebook environment) for large-scale backtesting, strategy optimization, or parallel trading experiments. Results are synced back to the main platform.
- **Dataset Integration**: Built-in support for public market datasets (e.g., CSV/JSON files of historical prices, open datasets from Kaggle or Yahoo Finance) for backtesting and live simulation. No API key required.
- **Trade Logging & Audit**: Every trade (simulated or real) is logged with timestamp, parameters, rationale, and result. Admins can review, filter, and export trade logs at any time.
- **Strategy Diversity**: The AI can run multiple trading strategies in parallel (momentum, mean reversion, ML-based, etc.), compare their performance, and adaptively switch or blend strategies based on results.
- **Offline/Batch Mode**: If the platform is offline, the AI continues to simulate trades using the latest available data and syncs results when back online.
- **Colab Integration Example**: Users can trigger a Colab notebook to run a trading simulation, upload a dataset, and return results to the Alpha-Q dashboard.

### Example: Trading Dataset Integration
- Place CSV/JSON datasets in a `/datasets/trading/` folder (e.g., `BTC_USD_2020.csv`).
- The AI loads these datasets for backtesting, simulation, and strategy training.
- Example dataset sources: Yahoo Finance, Kaggle, public crypto/stock archives.

### Example: Trading UI Panel (React/TypeScript)
```tsx
// components/TradingPanel.tsx
import { Card, Table, Button } from './ui';

export function TradingPanel({ trades, onSimulate, onColab }) {
  return (
    <Card title="Autonomous Trading Engine">
      <Button onClick={onSimulate}>Simulate Trade</Button>
      <Button onClick={onColab}>Run in Colab</Button>
      <Table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Time</th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Amount</th>
            <th>Result</th>
            <th>Rationale</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {trades.map(trade => (
            <tr key={trade.id}>
              <td>{new Date(trade.timestamp).toLocaleString()}</td>
              <td>{trade.type}</td>
              <td>{trade.amount}</td>
              <td>{trade.result}</td>
              <td>{trade.rationale}</td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </Table>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

### Example: Colab Integration (Python Snippet)
```python
# colab_trading_sim.py
import pandas as pd
# Load dataset from /datasets/trading/BTC_USD_2020.csv
prices = pd.read_csv('BTC_USD_2020.csv')
# Simulate a simple moving average strategy
prices['SMA'] = prices['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
trades = []
for i in range(20, len(prices)):
    if prices['Close'][i] > prices['SMA'][i]:
        trades.append({'timestamp': prices['Date'][i], 'type': 'BUY', 'amount': 1, 'result': 'SIMULATED', 'rationale': 'SMA cross'})
# Save results to CSV for Alpha-Q to import
pd.DataFrame(trades).to_csv('simulated_trades.csv', index=False)
```
