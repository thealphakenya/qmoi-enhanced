# QMOI Auto Projects - Enhanced AI Project Management

## Overview
QMOI Auto Projects is an advanced AI-driven project management system that automatically creates, manages, and evolves projects with full AI autonomy. **The system is now optimized to ensure every project contributes to a minimum daily earning target of Ksh 50,000 and maintains at least Ksh 50,000 in QMOI Space.**

## Minimum Earning Targets
- **Daily Target**: Ksh 50,000 minimum per day (enforced by automation)
- **QMOI Space Minimum**: Ksh 50,000 must always be available in QMOI Space (auto-replenish if below)
- **Automated Alerts**: Master is notified if targets are not met or balance drops below threshold

## Revenue Maximization Automation
- Every project is evaluated for revenue potential and quality before creation and distribution
- AI generates, documents, and creates trailers for each project to maximize earning and reach
- Multi-channel distribution: projects are sent to all relevant platforms for maximum exposure and revenue
- Marketing, deals, and pricing are optimized by AI and approved by master
- All actions, earnings, and optimizations are logged and auditable

## AI-Driven Idea Generation & Project Quality
- AI scans global trends, market data, and user feedback to generate new project and earning ideas
- Each idea is scored for revenue potential, feasibility, and quality
- Only the highest quality, most profitable ideas are executed
- Automated quality assurance: all projects are tested, reviewed, and improved before launch
- Trailers, documentation, and marketing assets are auto-generated for every project

## Enhanced Project & Revenue Workflow
1. **Idea Generation**: AI proposes high-revenue, high-quality project ideas
2. **Master Approval**: Master can approve, modify, or prioritize ideas
3. **Project Creation**: AI creates and manages projects, ensuring quality and revenue focus
4. **Asset Generation**: Documentation, trailers, and marketing materials are auto-generated
5. **Distribution & Marketing**: Projects are distributed to all relevant platforms for maximum earning
6. **Revenue Tracking**: All earnings are tracked, and targets are enforced
7. **Continuous Optimization**: AI monitors performance, optimizes strategies, and proposes improvements
