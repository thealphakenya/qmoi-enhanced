Notes & safety

The script creates remote backup branches (autosync-backup-*, autosync-safety-*) before risky operations so you can recover any local work.

It prefers safe operations (rebase/autostash then merge with theirs strategy if necessary); it does not perform an unconditional forced push to the main branch.

It logs everything to git-smart-sync.log and maintains .git-smart-sync.state to resume progress.

For extremely large repos, the chunking/resume logic will split the upload; it tries to minimize retries and re-sending large bundles by reusing git's incremental transfer behavior and by only reattempting missing objects.
