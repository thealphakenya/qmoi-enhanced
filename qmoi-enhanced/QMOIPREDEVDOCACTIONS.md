# QMOI Pre-Development Documentation & Actions

## Overview

This document outlines best practices and actionable steps for preparing QMOI for advanced automation, device integration, plugin/UI enhancements, analytics, reporting, and security.

---

## 1. Advanced Automation Rules & User-Defined Triggers

- Allow users to define custom automation rules (e.g., "If CPU > 80%, offload to cloud").
- Support event-based triggers for plugins and device actions.
- UI for creating, editing, and managing automation rules.
- Example triggers: device health, file changes, scheduled times, user actions.

## 2. Real Device API Integration

- Integrate real APIs for AWS, Azure, GCP, IoT, and Mobile device stubs.
- Use official SDKs and secure authentication.
- Provide UI for device connection, status, and management.
- Log all device actions for audit and troubleshooting.

## 3. Plugin & Device UI Enhancements

- Enable/disable toggles, status indicators, and notifications for all plugins/devices.
- Add settings panels, help modals, and onboarding for new features.
- Support for plugin/device grouping, filtering, and search.

## 4. Analytics, Reporting, & Security

- Add analytics dashboards for plugin/device usage, automation events, and system health.
- Generate and export reports (CSV, PDF) for audits and reviews.
- Implement security best practices: authentication, authorization, audit logging, and data protection.

## 5. Best Practices & Next Steps

- Keep documentation up to date with all new features and integrations.
- Regularly review automation rules and device integrations for performance and security.
- Expand plugin and device ecosystem with community contributions.
- Prioritize user experience, reliability, and transparency in all enhancements.
