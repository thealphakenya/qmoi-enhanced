# QMOI Optimization Guide

## Overview

This guide covers all strategies and features used by QCity/QMOI to optimize performance, minimize size, and maximize efficiency on any device or cloud.

## Key Optimization Features

- **Atomic/Temp Installs:** All dependencies are installed in a temp directory, then atomically moved to node_modules for reliability and speed.
- **Deduplication:** Duplicate dependencies are removed using npm/yarn/pnpm dedupe.
- **Tree-Shaking & Pruning:** Unused code and dependencies are removed before/after build/install.
- **On-Demand Loading:** Only required modules/features are loaded at runtime.
- **Compression:** Assets, logs, and artifacts are compressed for storage and transfer.
- **Minimal Local Footprint:** node_modules, build files, and caches are stored in QCity/cloud, with overlays/symlinks for local use.
- **Resource-Aware Execution:** Heavy tasks are throttled, offloaded, or scheduled for off-peak times.
- **Background/Parallel Execution:** Installs/builds/tests run in the background or in parallel, never blocking the UI or slowing the device.
- **Auto-Cleanup:** All temp files, caches, and unused artifacts are cleaned up after every operation.

## How to Use

- Enable/disable optimization features in `config/qcity-device-config.json`.
- Use the dashboard to monitor and trigger optimizations.
- See `API.md` for optimization endpoints.

## Device Resource Optimization Techniques (Expanded)

- **Multi-Language Support:** QCity manages Node, Python, Java, Go, Rust, C/C++, and more, handling all dependencies and tools atomically and efficiently.
- **Environment Detection:** Automatically detects and configures environments for each language.
- **Resource-Aware Execution:** Throttles or offloads tasks based on real-time device stats.
- **Process Isolation:** Runs heavy tasks in isolated processes or containers with resource limits.
- **Auto-Offload:** Automatically offloads heavy work to cloud/Colab if device is busy or low on resources.
- **User Controls:** Dashboard allows users to adjust thresholds, switch modes, and monitor all resources.
