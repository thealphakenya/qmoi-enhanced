## ðŸ†“ All Features, Always Free

- Unlimited parallel jobs, advanced analytics, premium integrations, and developer/manual-level error fixing are included at no cost.
- QMOI auto-installs all dependencies, fixes all errors, and provides real-time notifications and dashboard visualization for all actions.
- All features are visualized and managed in the QMOI dashboard, with full audit logs and documentation.
- All documentation (.md files) is always kept up to date and indexed in ALLMDFILESREFS.md.

[ENHANCEMENT] All paid features of all platforms (GitLab, Vercel, Quantum, HuggingFace, Gitpod, Netlify, etc.) are available for free in QMOI via its own clones. QVillage is the master-only HuggingFace clone with advanced features. QMOI can run entirely on Quantum/Colab/Dagshub, and only uses actual GitHub for storage/basic features. See QVILLAGE.md and all other .md docs.
