## Automated Fixes for Dependency and Version Issues

- The system now automatically detects and fixes pip version mismatches and npm peer dependency warnings.
- If you see errors like 'requires pip', 'pip is too old', 'peer dependency', or 'no matching version found', these will be auto-fixed by the self-healing system.
- In CI/CD, the GitHub Actions autofix script will trigger the self-healing script if such errors are found in workflow logs.
- For errors that cannot be auto-fixed, a GitHub issue will be created for manual review.
