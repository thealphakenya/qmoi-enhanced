# QMOI Auto-Fix System

## Overview
QMOI Auto-Fix is a comprehensive error detection and resolution system that automatically fixes all types of errors including build, lint, deployment, and configuration issues. It provides real-time monitoring, detailed reporting, and ensures successful deployment to Vercel.

## Features

### ðŸ”§ Comprehensive Error Fixing
- **Build Errors**: TypeScript, dependency, and compilation issues
- **Lint Errors**: ESLint, code style, and formatting issues  
- **Deployment Errors**: Vercel deployment, configuration, and environment issues
- **Environment Errors**: Missing files, configuration, and setup issues

### ðŸ“Š Real-Time Monitoring
- Live error tracking with timestamps
- Fix history with success/failure rates
- Performance metrics and execution time
- GitHub Actions integration for detailed reporting

### ðŸš€ Automated Deployment
- Automatic Vercel deployment after fixes
- Multiple deployment strategies with fallbacks
- Deployment status verification
- Rollback capabilities on failure

### ðŸ“ˆ GitHub Actions Integration
- Comprehensive workflow with detailed reporting
- Pre-fix and post-fix verification
- Step-by-step status tracking
- Performance metrics and error summaries

## Usage

### Manual Trigger
```bash
# Run comprehensive auto-fix
node scripts/enhanced-error-fix.js

# Check specific error types
npm run fix:build
npm run fix:lint
npm run fix:deploy
```

### GitHub Actions
The system automatically runs on:
- Push to main/develop branches
- Pull requests
- Scheduled runs (every 6 hours)
- Manual workflow dispatch

## Error Types Handled

### Build Errors
- Missing dependencies
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Package.json configuration issues
- Build script failures

### Lint Errors
- ESLint rule violations
- Code style issues
- Import/export problems
- Unused variables and imports

### Deployment Errors
- Vercel configuration issues
- Environment variable problems
- Build directory issues
- Network and timeout errors

### Environment Errors
- Missing .env files
- Configuration file corruption
- Permission issues
- System compatibility problems

## Fix Strategies

### Multi-Strategy Approach
1. **Primary Fix**: Standard resolution methods
2. **Alternative Fix**: Different approaches if primary fails
3. **Fallback Fix**: Conservative methods as last resort
4. **Manual Intervention**: Report when automatic fixes fail

### Retry Logic
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Multiple attempts for critical errors
- Graceful degradation on persistent issues

## Reporting

### GitHub Actions Summary
- Total errors and fix counts
- Execution time and performance metrics
- Detailed error and fix logs
- Deployment status and verification

### Real-Time Dashboard
- Live error status (master-only)
- Fix history with timestamps
- Success rate calculations
- GitHub Actions integration status

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
QMOI_AUTO_FIX=true
NODE_ENV=production
VERCEL_TOKEN=your_token
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token
```

### GitHub Actions Secrets
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: For deployment
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: For repository access
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: For notifications (optional)

## Performance

### Optimization Features
- Parallel error processing where possible
- Caching of successful fixes
- Incremental error detection
- Smart retry strategies

### Metrics Tracked
- Total execution time
- Errors per category
- Fix success rates
- Deployment success rate
- Performance trends

## Master Controls

### Dashboard Access
- Real-time error monitoring
- Manual fix triggering
- GitHub Actions status
- Performance analytics

### Advanced Features
- Custom fix strategies
- Error pattern recognition
- Automated reporting
- Notification management

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Fix Not Applied**: Check logs for manual intervention required
2. **Deployment Fails**: Verify Vercel configuration and tokens
3. **GitHub Actions Fail**: Check workflow permissions and secrets

### Manual Intervention
When automatic fixes fail, the system:
1. Logs detailed error information
2. Provides specific manual steps
3. Notifies master users
4. Maintains system stability

## ðŸš€ Always Fix All Automation

QMOI now includes a robust "Always Fix All" automation system:

- **Script:** `npm run qmoi:always-fix-all`
- **Location:** `scripts/qmoi-always-fix-all.js`
- **How it works:**
  - Runs all fixers (lint, build, config, dependency, runtime) in sequence
  - Retries up to 3 times if any errors remain
  - Logs all attempts to `logs/qmoi-always-fix-all-attempts.json`
  - Sends notifications on success or persistent failure
  - Integrates with QMOI notification and monitoring systems
- **Husky Integration:**
  - Runs automatically before every commit and push (see `.husky/pre-commit` and `.husky/pre-push`)
- **Best Practice:**
  - Use this script in CI/CD, pre-commit, pre-push, or manual runs for maximum reliability

### Example Usage
```bash
npm run qmoi:always-fix-all
```

### Monitoring & Troubleshooting
- All fix attempts and results are logged
- Persistent failures trigger notifications and require manual intervention
- See [MONITORING.md](./MONITORING.md) for dashboard and alerting

## ðŸ¤– AI Error Prediction

QMOI now includes an AI-powered error prediction system:
- Analyzes error/fix logs to predict likely error types and files for the next run
- Exposes predictions via a REST API (`/api/predictions` on port 4100)
- Predictions are displayed in the dashboard for proactive fixing

## ðŸ”” Notification Management

- Notification preferences can be managed via the dashboard or REST API (`/api/notification-prefs` on port 4200)
- Supports Slack, Discord, Telegram, and Pushover (mobile push)
- Notification history is viewable in the dashboard

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Enhancements

- AI error predictions and notification management are now visible on the dashboard
- Live notification log and manual notification preference management

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- AI-powered error prediction
- Advanced pattern recognition
- Cross-platform deployment support
- Enhanced notification systems

### Integration Roadmap
- Slack/Discord notifications
- Email alerts for critical issues
- Mobile app monitoring
- Advanced analytics dashboard
