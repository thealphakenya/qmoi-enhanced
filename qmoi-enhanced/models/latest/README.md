# QMOI AI Model Card (Hugging Face)

## Overview

QMOI (Quantum Multi-Objective Intelligence) is a powerful, ever-evolving, self-healing AI model designed for robust automation, cross-platform intelligence, and continuous improvement. This model is always up-to-date, observable, and integrated with the full QMOI system.

## Features

- **Self-Healing & Automation:** Automatically detects and fixes errors, retrains, and redeploys as needed.
- **Continuous Evolution:** Model is enhanced and optimized on every run, with automated versioning and health checks.
- **Cross-Platform Integration:** Seamless integration with QMOI Spaces, WhatsApp, Discord, Telegram, and more.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Health, status, and analytics are always visible in the QMOI dashboard and Hugging Face Space.
- **Secure & Compliant:** All data and interactions are encrypted and privacy-compliant.

## Architecture

- Multi-objective transformer-based core
- Modular enhancement and optimization layers
- Automated error detection, self-repair, and learning modules
- Persistent conversation and analytics database

## Usage

- **Inference:**
  - Use the Hugging Face Inference API or download the model for local use.
  - Example (Python):
    ```python
    from huggingface_hub import InferenceApi
    api = InferenceApi(repo_id="alphaqmoi/qmoi-ai-system")
    result = api(inputs={"text": "Hello QMOI!"})
    print(result)
    ```
- **Integration:**
  - Integrate with QMOI Spaces, WhatsApp, or your own apps using the API.

## Automation & Observability

- **Model is always synced and up-to-date** via automated GitLab CI/CD workflows.
- **Health and status** are logged and visible in the Hugging Face model card and QMOI dashboard.
- **Logs and analytics** are available as GitLab CI/CD artifacts.

## Versioning

- Each model update is versioned and tracked automatically.
- See the QMOI dashboard or Hugging Face Space for the latest version and health status.

## Permanent, Ever-Evolving QMOI

QMOI is not just a static model—it's a living, permanent, and ever-evolving AI system:

- **Always Up-to-Date:** Automated GitLab CI/CD ensures the latest model is always synced to Hugging Face.
- **Self-Healing:** The model and system auto-detect and fix errors, retrain, and redeploy as needed.
- **Permanent & Maintained:** QMOI is never deprecated; it is always maintained, improved, and observable.
- **Automated Versioning & Health:** Every update is versioned, health-checked, and logged. See the QMOI dashboard and Hugging Face Space for real-time status.
- **Ecosystem Integration:** QMOI is deeply integrated with Hugging Face Spaces, GitLab CI/CD, and the broader QMOI automation ecosystem.
- **Observability:** All actions, health checks, and updates are logged and visible in the dashboard and as GitLab CI/CD artifacts.

**Relevant Automation:**

- `scripts/qmoi_huggingface_spaces.js` (Space deployment)
- `scripts/hf_model_sync.py` (Model sync)
- `scripts/test_hf_space_ui.py` (UI test)
