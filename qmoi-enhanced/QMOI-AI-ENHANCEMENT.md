```bash
yarn qmoi:controller  # Central AI management
```

### **Layer 6: Super System**
```bash
yarn lint:super  # All systems combined
```

## üß† AI Intelligence Features

### **Error Classification**
The AI system can now classify errors into:
- **Module Import Issues**: `require` statements, ES6 imports
- **Node Global Issues**: `process`, `module`, `exports`
- **Undefined Variables**: Missing declarations
- **Unused Variables**: Dead code detection
- **Import Resolution**: Path and module issues
- **Debugging Code**: Console statements, debugger
- **Variable Declaration**: Const vs let optimization
- **Style Consistency**: Quotes, semicolons, formatting

### **Fix Strategy Determination**
AI determines the best approach for each error:
- **Remove Debug Code**: Delete console statements
- **Convert to Const**: Change let to const where appropriate
- **Remove or Prefix Variables**: Handle unused variables
- **Standardize Quotes**: Fix quote consistency
- **Add Semicolons**: Fix missing semicolons
- **Manual Review**: Flag for human attention

### **Confidence Scoring**
- **High Confidence (0.9)**: Console removal, const conversion, quotes, semicolons
- **Medium Confidence (0.7)**: Unused variables, trailing spaces
- **Low Confidence (0.5)**: Complex logic issues

### **Context-Aware Analysis**
- **File Type Detection**: Different strategies for .ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx
- **Surrounding Code Analysis**: Understands code context
- **Import Pattern Recognition**: Identifies import/export patterns
- **Variable Usage Tracking**: Tracks variable usage across files

## üìä Enhanced Error Handling

### **Before (Manual Process)**
```bash
yarn lint
# Manually read through 3,652 errors
# Manually fix each error one by one
# Run yarn lint again
# Repeat until clean
```

### **After (AI-Powered Process)**
```bash
yarn lint:super
# AI automatically:
# 1. Analyzes all 3,652 errors
# 2. Classifies them by type and severity
# 3. Applies intelligent fixes with confidence scoring
# 4. Handles complex errors that previously required manual work
# 5. Provides detailed reports and notifications
# 6. Learns from each fix to improve future performance
```

## June 2025: Full Automation of Account & Financial Verification

### Centralized Automation
- The QMOI Enhanced Controller (`scripts/qmoi-enhanced-controller.py`) now triggers all account and financial verifications automatically on startup.
- Supports `oneshot` (single run) and `daemon` (periodic, background) modes:
  - **Oneshot:** `python scripts/qmoi-enhanced-controller.py` ‚Äî runs all verifications and enhancements once.
  - **Daemon:** `python scripts/qmoi-enhanced-controller.py daemon` ‚Äî runs all verifications on startup and then every hour (configurable).
- All verification events (WhatsApp, Airtel Money, Mpesa, etc.) send instant WhatsApp notifications to the master.
- Financial and account verification scripts are now orchestrated by the controller for unified, master-only automation.

### Master Notification & Security
- Every verification, connection, and transaction triggers a WhatsApp notification to the master.
- All actions are logged for audit and compliance.

### Usage
- To enable full automation, use the daemon mode:
  ```sh
  python scripts/qmoi-enhanced-controller.py daemon
  ```
- To run a one-time verification and enhancement:
  ```sh
  python scripts/qmoi-enhanced-controller.py
  ```
