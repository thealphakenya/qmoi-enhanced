# QMOI Self-Evolution System

## Overview
QMOI features a self-evolving AI system that continuously adapts, optimizes, and improves itself using advanced automation, performance analytics, and large language models (LLMs).

## Key Capabilities
- **Continuous Self-Improvement**: Monitors performance, security, and user feedback to trigger self-updates.
- **Automated Dependency Upgrades**: Regularly updates dependencies and applies security patches.
- **Code Refactoring**: Uses LLMs to suggest and apply code improvements.
- **Self-Healing**: Detects and fixes errors, performance bottlenecks, and vulnerabilities automatically.
- **Auto-Documentation**: Updates documentation and changelogs as the system evolves.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Learns from user interactions and adapts features accordingly.

## How It Works
1. **Monitor**: Continuously monitors system health, performance, and security.
2. **Analyze**: Uses analytics and LLMs to identify improvement opportunities.
3. **Evolve**: Applies code changes, dependency upgrades, and configuration updates.
4. **Validate**: Runs tests and health checks to ensure stability.
5. **Document**: Updates documentation and logs all changes.

## LLM Integration
- Uses Hugging Face and other LLM APIs to:
  - Suggest code refactoring and optimizations
  - Generate documentation and changelogs
  - Analyze user feedback and recommend features

## Usage
- The self-evolution system runs as part of the master automation cycle.
- You can trigger manually:
  ```bash
  python scripts/qmoi_auto_evolution_enhanced.py --self-evolve
  ```

## Configuration
- See `config/master_evolution_config.json` for settings.

## Best Practices
- Review evolution reports regularly.
- Approve or revert major changes as needed.
