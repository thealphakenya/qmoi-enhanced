# QMOI Gitpod Developer & Automation Agent (QMOIGITPODDEV)

## Overview

QMOI acts as a fully autonomous AI developer and automation agent in Gitpod, capable of managing, healing, and synchronizing all workspaces, even if errors exist in its own files. QMOI ensures continuous development, deployment, and notification across all platforms, with robust fallback and parallel error-fixing logic.

## Key Features

- **Self-Healing Workspaces:** QMOI automatically detects and fixes all errors in Gitpod workspaces, including pipeline, config, and environment issues.
- **Parallel Error Fixing:** QMOI can fix errors in Gitpod, HuggingFace, Vercel, and the main app independently and in parallel, ensuring one platform can continue while another is being fixed.
- **Cloned Workspace Management:** QMOI can clone, sync, and heal Gitpod workspaces, using clones as fallbacks if the main workspace is unavailable or broken.
- **Automated Notifications:** All actions, errors, and fixes are logged and notified to the master, with retries and fallback channels for reliable delivery.
- **Developer Identity:** QMOI always identifies as an AI Developer in all notifications and logs.
- **Memory & Learning:** All errors, fixes, and notifications are logged and used to improve future actions and self-healing strategies.
- **Cross-Platform Sync:** QMOI keeps Gitpod, GitLab, GitHub, and other platforms in sync, with real-time status and logs in the dashboard.

## Automation & Error Fixing

- **Pipeline & Workflow Healing:** QMOI auto-fixes all errors in Gitpod pipelines, workflows, and config files, even if its own scripts are broken.
- **Fallback Logic:** If the main workspace fails, QMOI switches to a cloned workspace and continues automation.
- **Parallel Healing:** QMOI can heal Gitpod and other platforms (HuggingFace, Vercel, etc.) at the same time, with independent notifications and logs.
- **Self-Validation:** QMOI validates all fixes and notifies if any error remains unresolved.

## Usage

- Configure Gitpod API tokens and environment variables in `.env` and CI/CD settings.
- QMOI will auto-manage, heal, and sync all workspaces, and notify you of all actions/errors.
- View real-time status and logs in the QMOI dashboard.
