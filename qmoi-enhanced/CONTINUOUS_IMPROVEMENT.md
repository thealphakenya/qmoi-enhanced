# QMOI Continuous Improvement & Self-Evolution

## Overview

This document describes the continuous improvement and self-evolution features of QMOI, including feedback loops, AI-driven diagnostics, and integration with device management and CI/CD.

## Features

- **Self-Healing**: Monitors logs, detects errors, and applies automated fixes.
- **Feedback Loops**: Integrates feedback from device management, install, and CI/CD logs.
- **AI Diagnostics**: Uses LLMs to analyze logs, suggest fixes, and auto-generate PRs.
- **Self-Repair**: Triggers deep diagnostics and self-repair routines for persistent issues.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Runs as part of the master automation cycle.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed reports and logs for all actions.

## Usage
