# QMOI Registry - Enhanced System Documentation

## Overview
The QMOI Registry is the central intelligence and automation hub for the QMOI system. It tracks all components, devices, actions, errors, fixes, feedback, and analytics. The enhanced registry supports real-time feedback loops, advanced AI triggers, external API integration, auto-evolution, error/fix tracking, registry-driven scheduling, multi-agent collaboration, and analytics dashboards.

## Key Features

### 1. Feedback Loops
- Records user, system, and AI feedback in real time
- Feedback is analyzed to trigger optimizations, error fixes, or new project/marketing actions
- Supports both manual and automated feedback entries

### 2. AI Action Tracking
- Logs every AI action, trigger, and outcome (e.g., project generation, marketing launch, error fix)
- Enables full auditability and learning from past actions
- Used for feedback-driven optimization and auto-evolution

### 3. External API Integration
- Syncs with real-time external APIs (e.g., bank, trading, market data)
- API data is stored in the registry and used for decision-making, analytics, and automation
- Example: Syncing a real bank API for live balance
  ```bash
  node scripts/qmoi-registry-manager.js --sync-api bank https://api.mybank.com/balance?account=12345
  ```
- Example: Syncing a trading API for live market data
  ```bash
  node scripts/qmoi-registry-manager.js --sync-api trading https://api.mytrading.com/markets
  ```

### 4. Auto-Evolution & Self-Healing
- Registry can trigger self-updates, optimizations, and error fixes based on analytics and feedback
- Example: If a critical error is detected, registry can auto-trigger the auto-enhancement system
  ```bash
  node scripts/qmoi-registry-manager.js --auto-evolve "Critical error detected"
  ```

### 5. Advanced Error/Fix Tracking
- Every error, fix, and outcome is logged with context and suggestions
- Enables learning from past issues and improving future responses
- Example: Recording an error and fix
  ```bash
  node scripts/qmoi-registry-manager.js --feedback error system "API timeout"
  node scripts/qmoi-registry-manager.js --ai-action fix error "Timeout resolved"
  ```

### 6. Registry-Driven Scheduling
- Registry can schedule and trigger actions (e.g., project launches, marketing, error fixes) based on analytics, feedback, or external events
- Supports both time-based and event-driven scheduling

### 7. Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Tracks actions and feedback from multiple QMOI agents or modules
- Enables collaborative problem-solving, project execution, and optimization
- Registry can coordinate actions between agents for large or complex tasks

### 8. Analytics Dashboards
- Registry stores analytics data for revenue, project success, error rates, and more
- Data can be visualized in dashboards or exported for further analysis
- Example: Running analytics from CLI
  ```bash
  node scripts/qmoi-revenue-enforcer.js --analytics
  node scripts/qmoi-registry-manager.js --list
  ```

## Usage Examples

- **Record feedback:**
  ```bash
  node scripts/qmoi-registry-manager.js --feedback user dashboard "Great new feature!"
  ```
- **Record AI action:**
  ```bash
  node scripts/qmoi-registry-manager.js --ai-action project_generation auto-triggered success
  ```
- **Sync with external API:**
  ```bash
  node scripts/qmoi-registry-manager.js --sync-api bank https://api.mybank.com/balance?account=12345
  ```
- **Trigger auto-evolution:**
  ```bash
  node scripts/qmoi-registry-manager.js --auto-evolve "Performance optimization"
  ```
- **Optimize from feedback:**
  ```bash
  node scripts/qmoi-registry-manager.js --optimize-feedback
  ```
- **List registry contents:**
  ```bash
  node scripts/qmoi-registry-manager.js --list
  ```

## Best Practices
- Regularly sync with external APIs for up-to-date data
- Use feedback and AI action tracking to drive continuous improvement
- Leverage registry-driven scheduling for automation and reliability
- Enable multi-agent collaboration for complex or large-scale tasks
- Monitor analytics dashboards to track performance and identify opportunities
