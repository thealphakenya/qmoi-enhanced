## QCity Runners Engine: Orchestrator for Device Management

QMOI now uses the QCity Runners Engine (see QCITYRUNNERSENGINE.md) to orchestrate all device management, optimization, and self-healing. All devices:

- Continuously self-check, auto-fix, and auto-update
- Learn from errors, usage, and performance to evolve and optimize
- Can auto-improve their own configs, scripts, and suggest code changes (Self-Developer)
- Are monitored and managed via the dashboard with live status and audit logs

### Self-Developer Devices

Devices can now auto-improve their own configurations, scripts, and even suggest or apply code changes to optimize performance and reliability.

### Ever-Evolving Devices

Devices learn from errors, usage patterns, and performance data, adapting automatically to new requirements and environments.
