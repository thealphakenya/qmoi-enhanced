> **See also:** [QMOIDEV.md](./QMOIDEV.md)

## QMOI as a Developer & Notification Agent
- QMOI always identifies as an AI Developer in all notifications (email, Slack, etc.).
- All notifications include platform, job, fix, and error context.
- QMOI logs, retries, and uses fallback channels for all notifications.
- QMOI monitors for email replies, parses commands, and updates memory/context.
- All errors, fixes, and notifications are logged and used to improve future actions.
