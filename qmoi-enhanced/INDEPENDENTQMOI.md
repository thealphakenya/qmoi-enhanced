## Platform Independence & Cloned Platforms

- QMOI does not use the actual platforms (e.g., Gitpod, GitLab, GitHub, Vercel, etc.) for any automation, CI/CD, or development.
- All operations are performed on QMOI's own cloned, independent platforms, which are fully controlled, self-healing, and optimized.
- This ensures complete autonomy, security, and performance for all QMOI activities.
- See QMOICLONE.md for details on cross-platform cloning and infrastructure.
