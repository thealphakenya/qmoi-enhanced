# QMOI Revenue Engine & M-Pesa Integration

## Overview

QMOI is now a fully automated revenue generation system that continuously makes money through multiple streams and automatically transfers earnings to your M-Pesa account. **The system is now optimized to generate a minimum of Ksh 50,000 per day and maintain at least Ksh 50,000 in QMOI Space.**

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Create `.env.production` with your credentials:

```bash
# M-Pesa Configuration
CASHON_MPESA_NUMBER=0725382624
QMOI_PROD_CREDENTIAL=your_production_credential

# M-Pesa API Credentials (Get from Safaricom)
MPESA_CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key
MPESA_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret
MPESA_PASSKEY=your_passkey
MPESA_SHORTCODE=your_shortcode
MPESA_ENVIRONMENT=production
MPESA_INITIATOR_NAME=QMOI
MPESA_SECURITY_CREDENTIAL=your_security_credential

# QMOI Master Token
QMOI_MASTER_TOKEN=your_master_token

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

### 2. Start Revenue Engine

```bash
# Start the revenue engine
npm run revenue:start

# Check current earnings
npm run revenue:status

# Or use the standalone script
node scripts/start-revenue-engine.js
```

### 3. Monitor Dashboard

Access the revenue dashboard at `/qcity` (master only) to:

- View real-time earnings
- Monitor revenue streams
- Control the engine
- Transfer to M-Pesa

## üí∞ Revenue Streams & Minimum Targets
