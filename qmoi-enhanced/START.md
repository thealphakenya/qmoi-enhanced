# QMOI Start Guide

## 🚀 How to Start or Resume QMOI (QCity & Cloud)

To ensure QMOI is always running (even in the cloud or when your device is offline), use the following command:

```bash
python scripts/qmoi-start.py
```

- This script will:
  - Check if QMOI is already running (locally or in the cloud)
  - Show the status of the running system
  - If not running, it will start/resume all QMOI automation, error fixing, and cloud features (QCity, Colab, Dagshub, etc.)
  - Ensure all features are always-on and self-healing

## 📊 Status

- The script will display the current status and health of QMOI, including error fixing, cloud sync, and notifications.

## 🛡️ Always-On

- QMOI is designed to keep running in the cloud, so you never miss an event or fix—even if your device is offline.
