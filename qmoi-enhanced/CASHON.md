# CASHON.md - QMOI AI Earning System

## Overview
The QMOI AI Earning System is a fully autonomous money-making platform that operates 24/7, even when users are offline. It integrates with Pesapal for real-time balance tracking and multiple earning strategies.

## Master-Only Fund Management & Approval Flows
- **Master-Only Access:** Only the master can access, transfer, or withdraw funds from Cashon (Pesapal).
- **Wallet Requests:** Users can request wallets, but creation only happens after explicit master approval (via WhatsApp or dashboard).
- **Fund Transfers:** All user-initiated fund transfers require master approval. The AI notifies the master instantly and logs all actions.
- **Audit Logging & Notifications:** Every sensitive action (wallet creation, fund transfer, earning) is logged, encrypted, and instantly reported to the master. Users are notified of approvals or denials.
- **UI/UX & WhatsApp Integration:** The UI and WhatsApp bot show request/approval status and allow the master to approve or deny actions in real time.
- **Resilience & Fallback:** All automation, earning, and error-fixing features work even if other parts of the system are not fully set up or are broken. Fallback and error handling are built-in for all fund and wallet actions.

- Production credentials are stored as `QMOI_PROD_CREDENTIAL` in `.env.production`.
- These files are excluded from git and must be managed securely by the master.

## Automated Revenue Transfer

- QMOI automatically credits all earnings to the Cashon wallet.
- Periodically, QMOI transfers funds from Cashon to the M-Pesa account (`0725382624`).
- All transactions are logged and visible in the master dashboard.
- Manual and auto-withdrawal options are available for the master.

## Security

- Credentials are never hardcoded or committed to git.
- If credentials are missing or invalid, QMOI blocks sensitive operations and alerts the master.

## Credential Rotation & Backup

- To rotate credentials, update `.env.production` and restart QMOI.
- Optionally, encrypt and back up `.env.production` to a secure location (never in git).
- If credentials are missing or a transfer fails, QMOI will alert the master via WhatsApp/email.
