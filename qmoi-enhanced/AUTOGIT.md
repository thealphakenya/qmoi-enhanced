# AUTOGIT.md

## AutoGit (Deprecated)

> **Note:** The legacy AutoGit system has been fully replaced by the new QMOI always-on, multi-channel, cross-platform automation engine. All git operations (commit, push, pull, error-fix, notifications) are now handled by:
>
> - `scripts/qmoi-auto-push.js`
> - `scripts/auto-git-update.js`
> - `scripts/qmoi-qcity-automatic.py`
> - `scripts/qmoi-enhanced-master-automation.py`
> - `scripts/qmoi_notification_manager.py`
>
> All actions are logged, self-healing, and fully integrated with the QCity dashboard and master-only controls. Notifications are sent via all configured channels.

### Migration

- Remove any references to legacy AutoGit scripts/configs.
- Use the new automation scripts for all git operations.
- See `ALLMDFILESREFS.md` and `git.txt` for updated command references.
