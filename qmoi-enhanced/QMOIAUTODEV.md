QMOI Auto-Dev: Always-On, Self-Healing, Auto-Deploying System
QMOI Auto-Dev is the heartbeat of the Alpha-Q ecosystem. It continuously monitors, fixes, commits, deploys, and optimizes every part of the system in real time — with zero manual effort.

🧠 Key Highlights
Feature Description
🔄 Continuous Daemon Runs 24/7, scanning logs, errors, running tests, and triggering fixes.
⚙️ Unified CI/CD Auto commit → push → deploy (e.g. Vercel) on every successful fix.
🖥️ Dashboard Control Master-only dashboard to view status, logs, trigger or stop the daemon.
📜 Audit Logging All actions (fixes, commits, deploys) are logged for transparency.
🧹 Auto-Cleanup Obsolete logs and files are deleted/rotated for performance.

🚀 Usage
Runs Automatically in background (no manual trigger required).

Daemon Frequency: Runs every 60 seconds by default.

Auto GitHub + Vercel operations — no manual deploy needed.

Admin/Master UI available via QCity dashboard.

Everything Logged in audit and status logs.
