## 6. Integration with Existing QMOI Kernel

### Enhanced Kernel Panel

- Updated `src/components/q-city/QMoiKernelPanel.tsx` to include enhanced dashboard
- Toggle between basic and enhanced views
- Seamless integration with existing QMOI functionality

### API Integration

All enhanced services are designed to work with existing QMOI APIs:

- `/api/qmoi/status` - Enhanced status reporting
- `/api/qmoi/payload` - Extended payload capabilities
- Real-time event streaming for dashboard updates

## QMOI Kernel Panel & useQmoiKernel Hook

### Overview

The QMOI Kernel Panel provides real-time control and monitoring of the QMOI system, including error fixing, optimization, and security actions. It now uses a custom React hook, `useQmoiKernel`, for all API logic and state management.

### useQmoiKernel Hook

- Encapsulates all QMOI kernel API logic: status fetching, action execution (QFix, QOptimize, QSecure), loading/error state, and last action result.
- Returns: `status`, `loading`, `error`, `lastAction`, `fetchStatus`, `runAction`.
- Used by `QMoiKernelPanel` for clean, reusable state management.

#### API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/qmoi/status` — fetches current kernel status, last check, mutation count, and logs.
- `POST /api/qmoi/payload?qfix|qoptimize|qsecure` — triggers kernel actions.

### QMoiKernelPanel UI/UX Enhancements

- **Manual Refresh**: Button to manually refresh kernel status.
- **Loading Indicators**: Buttons show loading state and are disabled during async actions.
- **Tooltips**: Each action button has a tooltip explaining its function.
- **Error Handling**: Errors are displayed in the panel.
- **Last Action Result**: Shows the result of the last action (success/failure, message).
- **Improved Logs**: Logs are displayed with better formatting.

### Props

- `isMaster` (boolean): Only renders the panel if true.

### Example Usage

```tsx
<QMoiKernelPanel isMaster={true} />
```

## Advanced E2E Testing & CI Integration

### Error Simulation & Accessibility

- Cypress E2E tests simulate API errors and slow responses using `cy.intercept`.
- Accessibility is checked with `cypress-axe`.
- See `cypress/e2e/qmoi_kernel_panel_advanced.cy.js` for examples.

### CI Integration

- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/cypress.yml`) runs Cypress E2E tests on every push/PR.
- Waits for the app to start, then runs all E2E tests.

### Expanding Coverage

- Add similar tests for other panels/components (e.g., EnhancedQMOIDashboard).
- Test edge cases, role-based access, and mobile/responsive layouts.
- Use MSW and Cypress together for robust integration and E2E coverage.

## Multi-User, Mobile, and Coverage Testing

### Multi-User & Mobile E2E

- Cypress tests simulate different user roles (admin, user) via cookies.
- Mobile/responsive layouts tested with `cy.viewport` (e.g., iPhone 6).
- Accessibility checks run on mobile as well.
- See `cypress/e2e/qmoi_kernel_panel_multiuser_mobile.cy.js` for examples.

### Code Coverage

- Run `npm run test:coverage` for Jest/RTL coverage (unit/integration).
- For Cypress E2E coverage, install `@cypress/code-coverage` and follow setup instructions in `package.json`.
- Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage/` directory and can be uploaded to Codecov or Coveralls.

### CI Configs

- GitHub Actions: see `.github/workflows/cypress.yml`.
- GitLab CI: see `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
- Both run E2E tests and can upload coverage artifacts for dashboards.
