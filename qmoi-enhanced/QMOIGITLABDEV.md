# QMOI GitLab Development & Integration

## üöÄ GitLab Mirroring, Auto-Update, and Failover
- QMOI GitLab is always auto-updated from the actual GitLab repository.
- If the real GitLab is unavailable for any reason, QMOI can use its own GitLab mirror as a backup or replacement, ensuring continuous automation and CI/CD.
- All GitLab actions, updates, and failover events are visualized in the dashboard, with real-time status and notifications.
- QMOI ensures all permissions, webhooks, and CI/CD logic are kept in sync between the real GitLab and the QMOI mirror.
- Master can control, audit, and override GitLab mirroring and failover from the dashboard.

## QMOI as a Developer & Notification Agent
- QMOI always identifies as an AI Developer in all notifications (email, Slack, etc.).
- All notifications include platform, job, fix, and error context.
- QMOI logs, retries, and uses fallback channels for all notifications.
- QMOI monitors for email replies, parses commands, and updates memory/context.
- All errors, fixes, and notifications are logged and used to improve future actions.

## Overview
QMOI now acts as a full developer/operator for GitLab:
- Creates and manages repos, variables, webhooks
- Runs/fixes pipelines, manages secrets, updates docs
- Backs up code, configs, and logs
- Integrates with master-only UI for control and logs

## Features
- **Resource Management:**
  - Auto-creates repos, sets up variables and webhooks
  - Syncs with other platforms (GitHub, DagsHub, etc.)
- **Pipeline Automation:**
  - Runs, monitors, and fixes pipelines
  - Auto-fixes errors and redeploys
- **Secrets Management:**
  - Loads tokens from `.env` and CI/CD variables
  - Warns if missing, never logs secrets
- **Backup & Auto-Evolution:**
  - Backs up all code, configs, and logs
  - Maintains changelog and evolves based on error/fix history
- **UI Integration:**
  - Master-only UI for pipeline/log/resource control
  - Real-time status, logs, and manual/auto triggers

## Usage
- Configure `.env` and GitLab CI/CD variables
- Push code or trigger pipeline
- QMOI will auto-manage resources, run/fix pipeline, and log all actions
- View status/logs in QCity/QI UI (master only)

## Extension Points
- Add new GitLab features or integrations
- Extend error-fixing and backup logic
- Integrate with more UI panels or controls

## Troubleshooting
- All errors, fixes, and actions are logged
- Backups are stored in `qmoi-backups/`
- For issues, check logs and UI panels

## üõ†Ô∏è Automated Build & Pipeline Error Fixing
- QMOI, as a dev, now automatically detects and fixes all errors from running `npm run build` and all other commands/scripts in the GitLab pipeline.
- On any job failure, QMOI analyzes the error, applies the fix, and re-runs the job automatically.
- All error-fix and job/retry events are visualized in the dashboard, with real-time logs and notifications to the master.
- QMOI can run multiple job fix cycles in parallel, ensuring rapid CI/CD and minimal downtime.
- Master can review, approve, or override any automated fix from the dashboard. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Full Automation: Setup, Installation, and Self-Healing
- QMOI now fully automates all setup and installation steps, ensuring everything is always running and up to date.
- QMOI auto-installs all required dependencies (npm, pip, system packages, etc.) and verifies their integrity.
- If any script is missing or broken, QMOI auto-creates or fixes it, including adding new scripts as needed.
- All setup, install, and self-healing actions are visualized in the dashboard, with real-time logs and notifications.
- Master can review, approve, or override any automated setup or fix from the dashboard.

## üîÑ GitHub Repo Auto-Update & Sync
- QMOI always pushes all changes to the GitHub repo, keeping all files in sync with the latest state.
- If the GitHub repo does not exist, QMOI auto-creates it and sets up all required permissions and webhooks.
- All GitHub push and sync events are visualized in the dashboard, with real-time logs and notifications.
- Master can view the full push/sync history, filter by date/status, and export logs.
- QMOI ensures GitHub and GitLab are always in sync, providing full redundancy and backup. 

## Enhanced GitLab Developer & Automation Features
- **Parallel Error Fixing:** QMOI can fix errors in GitLab, Gitpod, GitHub, HuggingFace, and Vercel independently and in parallel.
- **Self-Healing Pipelines & Workflows:** QMOI auto-detects and fixes all errors in its own files, pipelines, and workflows on GitLab, even if its own scripts are broken.
- **Fallback & Sync:** If GitLab is unavailable, QMOI uses GitHub or Gitpod as a fallback, keeping all platforms in sync.
- **Independent Notifications:** QMOI sends GitLab-specific error/fix notifications, and logs all actions for audit and learning.
- **Master Control:** Master can review, approve, or override any automated fix or setup from the dashboard. 

- All automation, error fixing, deployment, and notifications are now handled exclusively by GitLab CI/CD.
