# QMOI GitLab Integration & Automation Guide

## 1. Project Setup

- **Create a new GitLab project** or fork the QMOI template.
- **Clone the repository** to your local machine or preferred cloud IDE (e.g., Gitpod).
- **Add required environment variables** in GitLab CI/CD settings:
  - `GITLAB_TOKEN`: Your GitLab personal access token (with API and write permissions).
  - `GITLAB_PROJECT_ID`: Your project ID (find in project settings).
  - Any other QMOI-required variables (see `.env.example` if present).

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline

- The provided `.gitlab-ci.yml` automates build, test, and deployment for QMOI.
- **Features:**
  - Auto-fixes errors and redeploys on failure (see WATCHDEBUG integration).
  - Publishes npm packages if configured.
  - Logs all actions and notifies the master.
- **How to use:**
  - Push code to any branch; pipeline runs automatically.
  - Monitor pipeline status in the GitLab UI.
  - Failed pipelines are auto-retried and fixed by QMOI automation.

## 3. Developer Features & UI Automation

- **QCity UI Integration:**
  - Real-time status, logs, and controls for all GitLab pipelines and deployments.
  - Master-only controls for manual retry, cancel, or redeploy.
  - All actions are logged and auditable.
- **Automated Documentation Updates:**
  - All .md files are auto-updated after each deployment or code change.
  - Update history is visible in the QCity dashboard and GitLab UI.
- **Self-Healing Automation:**
  - QMOI monitors all pipelines and auto-fixes errors using WATCHDEBUG.
  - Master receives notifications for all critical events.

## 4. Troubleshooting

- **Pipeline Fails:**
  - QMOI auto-retries and attempts to fix errors.
  - Check logs in GitLab UI and QCity dashboard.
  - Manual intervention: Use QCity UI or WhatsApp commands (if enabled).
- **Environment Issues:**
  - Ensure all required variables are set in GitLab CI/CD settings.
  - Check for missing dependencies in `package.json` or `requirements.txt`.
- **UI/Automation Issues:**
  - Refresh QCity dashboard or GitLab UI.
  - Check for updates to QMOI scripts and documentation.

## 5. Advanced Usage

- **Customizing Pipelines:**
  - Edit `.gitlab-ci.yml` to add or modify stages (build, test, deploy, etc.).
  - Integrate with QMOI friendship, revenue, and monitoring systems as needed.
- **Audit & Compliance:**
  - All actions are logged for compliance and traceability.
  - Audit logs are accessible to the master in the QCity UI.

## 6. Automation & Monitoring

- **WATCHDEBUG Integration:**
  - Monitors all GitLab pipelines and deployments.
  - Auto-fixes errors and redeploys as needed.
  - Logs and notifies master of all critical events.

## Universal Runner Engine

- Platform-aware runners auto-detect GitLab and load GitLab-specific modules
- Elastic, parallel, and self-healing: scale up/down, split jobs, auto-offload to cloud, auto-recover from errors
- AI/ML-driven optimization: runners analyze logs, performance, and errors across all platforms, auto-suggest/apply optimizations

## New Dashboard Widgets

- Platform Status Cards: GitLab card shows pipeline status, runners, last sync, errors
- Universal Trigger Panel: trigger any job (build, test, deploy, sync, backup, optimize) on GitLab
- Elastic Scaling Panel: runner count, scale up/down, resource usage
- Cross-Platform Job Matrix: jobs x platforms grid, status/logs/error/fix icons
- Clone Health & Sync Panel: sync status, last backup, error/fix history, Sync Now/Force Heal
- AI/ML Insights Panel: recommendations for GitLab, Apply/Ignore
- Evolution History Panel: timeline of auto-evolutions, improvements, rollbacks
- Master-Only Controls: advanced settings, manual override, audit logs

## AI/ML Automation & Cross-Platform Learning

- AI/ML models aggregate logs/errors/fixes from GitLab and other platforms
- Fixes/optimizations that work on GitLab are auto-suggested/applied to others
- Runners self-evolve to support new GitLab features
- Auto-feature generation: AI proposes new features/scripts based on usage/errors/feedback
- All major changes require master approval

## Usage & Troubleshooting

- Use dashboard widgets to monitor GitLab status, trigger jobs, view logs, and apply AI/ML recommendations
- Master can trigger any job, scale runners, or force sync/heal
- All actions, fixes, and enhancements are logged and auditable
- For errors, use logs and AI/ML suggestions; master can override or roll back as needed

## UI/UX Mockup

(Same as in QMOICLONE.md, with GitLab-specific emphasis)

## Command Reference

See [CMDCOMMANDS.md](./CMDCOMMANDS.md) for all automation, testing, and troubleshooting commands for QMOI across all platforms (PowerShell, Bash, etc.).

### Troubleshooting

- If you see `Missing script: "qmoi:autodev:full"`, add it to your `package.json` under `"scripts"`.
- For PowerShell, use `;` to separate commands. For Bash, use `&&`.
- If you see `{ was unexpected at this time.`, you may be using CMD instead of PowerShell. Use PowerShell or run commands one by one in CMD.
