# \# QMOI - Quantum Master Orchestrator Intelligence

# 

# \## üöÄ Overview

# QMOI is a fully automated, always-on, cross-platform automation engine. It runs in the cloud (Colab, Dagshub, etc.) for 24/7 operation, even when your device is offline. QMOI features real-time Gmail notifications, parallel error fixing, instant deployment/download for all devices, and universal app delivery.

# 

# \## ‚ú® Key Features

# \- \*\*Always-On Cloud Automation:\*\* Runs in Colab/Dagshub for 24/7 operation

# \- \*\*Automated Gmail \& Multi-Channel Notifications:\*\* Real-time alerts for all events (fixes, deployments, health checks, downloads) via Gmail, WhatsApp, Slack, Telegram, Discord

# \- \*\*Parallel Engine:\*\* Fast, lightweight, and resource-efficient automation across all platforms

# \- \*\*Universal App Builder:\*\* Automated builds for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, QCity/Web, and more

# \- \*\*Device-Aware Download:\*\* QI/first page detects device and offers the correct installer

# \- \*\*User-Triggered \& Scheduled Builds:\*\* Trigger builds via API, dashboard, or on a schedule

# \- \*\*CI/CD Integration:\*\* Automated builds and artifact uploads on code push

# \- \*\*Real-Time Info Script:\*\* Instantly view errors fixed, code/file changes, health checks, and more

# \- \*\*App Download Link:\*\* Receive a working download link for the full QMOI app via Gmail and all channels as soon as everything is fixed

# \- \*\*Automated Health Checks \& Autotests:\*\* All health checks and autotests run continuously, are logged to QCity, and are visible in real time on the dashboard (master-only access to logs and controls).

# \- \*\*Self-Healing \& Error-Free Downloads:\*\* App downloads are only enabled if all health checks and autotests pass. Apps are always up to date, error-free, and auto-updating after install.

# \- \*\*Advanced QI Download:\*\* Device-aware, feature-selectable, and always provides the correct, up-to-date installer.

# \- \*\*Expanded Platform Stats:\*\* Dashboard now shows status for GitLab, GitHub, Vercel, Gitpod, Netlify, HuggingFace, Quantum, Village, Azure, AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, and more, each with icons and names.

# \- \*\*Master-Only Controls:\*\* Advanced dashboard features, logs, and controls are only visible to master/admin users.

# \- \*\*Ngrok Tunnel Automation:\*\* QMOI can automatically start, monitor, and update ngrok tunnels for all download and service endpoints. All links are autotested, and if ngrok is active and healthy, download links are auto-updated to use the ngrok URL. See QMOINGROK.md for details.

# 

# \## üì¶ App Delivery \& Qmoi\_apps Structure

# \- All apps are built and organized in `Qmoi\_apps/<device>/` (e.g., windows, mac, linux, android, ios, qcity, ...)

# \- Each device subdirectory contains the latest installer for \*\*qmoi ai\*\* (e.g., `qmoi ai.exe` for Windows, `qmoi ai.apk` for Android) and QCity

# \- Download links are always up to date and device-aware

# \- \*\*App icons are now modern, visually enhanced, and consistent across platforms\*\*

# \- \*\*Download is only enabled if all health checks and autotests pass.\*\*

# \- \*\*Ngrok Tunnel Support:\*\* If ngrok is active and healthy, download links are auto-updated to use the ngrok URL. If ngrok is unavailable, QMOI falls back to Freenom or other providers. See QMOINGROK.md for details.

# 

# \## üîê Secure Credential Storage

# \- The ngrok auth token is never stored in plaintext in code or .md files.

# \- QMOI uses encrypted environment variables, secret managers (e.g., Colab secrets, cloud secret stores), or OS keyring for storing the token.

# \- Only the automation engine and master/admin have access to the token.

# \- All access to the token is logged and auditable.

# 

# \## üõ°Ô∏è Download Reliability, Autofix, and Customer Care

# \- \*\*All download links are autotested and auto-fixed by QCity runners.\*\*

# \- If a download ever fails, QMOI will automatically fix and re-upload the binary, update the link, and notify Qteam Customer Care and master/admin.

# \- Download UI and scripts feature robust error handling, retry logic, and real-time status ("Autofixing...", "Retrying...", "Fixed!").

# \- Users can report issues directly from the download UI; all issues are logged and prioritized for immediate fix.

# \- \*\*Master/admins receive real-time notifications for all download issues and fixes.\*\*

# \- For persistent issues, contact Qteam Customer Care via the app or email.

# 

# \## New Integrations \& Enhancements

# \- \*\*Ngrok Integration:\*\* QMOI can use ngrok for secure, always-on, cloud-accessible download and service links. All links are autotested, and if ngrok is active, links are updated to use the ngrok URL. See QMOINGROK.md for details.

# 

# \## üîÑ Build Automation

# \- Builds are triggered automatically on code push (see CI/CD), by user request (API), or on a schedule

# \- All build/test/install actions are logged and self-healing

# \- \*\*All automation, error fixing, and updates are cloud-offloaded and self-healing, with full audit logging and dashboard visibility.\*\*

# 

# \## üèÉ QCity Runners Engine (Self-Hosted, Self-Healing, Ever-Evolving)

# QMOI now features the QCity Runners Engine:

# \- \*\*Self-Error-Fixing:\*\* Runners auto-detect, auto-fix, and auto-restart on failure

# \- \*\*Ever-Evolving:\*\* Runners auto-update, optimize, and learn from build/test failures

# \- \*\*Self-Developer:\*\* Runners can auto-improve CI scripts, workflows, and even code

# \- \*\*Universal Deployment:\*\* Deploy runners on any OS, cloud (Colab, DagsHub, QCity), or local device

# \- \*\*Live Monitoring:\*\* Dashboard shows runner health, build history, and error trends

# \- \*\*Full Automation:\*\* All builds are self-fixing, self-documenting, and always up to date

# \- \*\*All health checks, autotests, and error fixing are logged to QCity and visible in the dashboard (master-only).\*\*

# 

# See `QCITYRUNNERSENGINE.md` for full details.

# 

# \## üñ•Ô∏è Real-Time Dashboard \& Cloud Deployment

# 

# \- Run the QMOI dashboard for real-time logs, reports, and health:

# &nbsp; ```bash

# &nbsp; python scripts/qmoi-dashboard.py

# &nbsp; # Access at http://localhost:5055

# &nbsp; ```

# \- Use the cloud deploy script to keep all automation, live status, and dashboard running in Colab, DagsHub, or any cloud:

# &nbsp; ```bash

# &nbsp; bash scripts/qmoi-cloud-deploy.sh

# &nbsp; # All services are always-on, auto-restarting, and cloud-offloaded

# &nbsp; ```

# \- See also: DEPLOYMENT-README.md for advanced deployment and monitoring.

# \*\*QMOI: Always-on, secure, and fully automated for the future of cross-platform orchestration.\*\*

# 

# \[ENHANCEMENT] All QCity and QMOI activities (automation, error fixing, AI/ML, dashboard, etc.) are now offloaded to Colab, Dagshub, and cloud environments. Local device resources are never used for heavy or critical tasks; only UI and user interactions run locally. QMOI exclusively uses its own cloned GitLab and Gitpod platforms, which are more advanced and optimized than the actual ones. Actual GitLab/Gitpod are never used for automation, CI/CD, or development. See also: QMOIAVATAR.md, QMOIAICORE.md, QMOIAUTOEVOLVE.md, CMDCOMMANDS.md, .gitlab-ci.yml, and all .md docs for cross-platform and cloud-offloading details.

# \## Cloud Offloading \& Cloned Platform Usage (2025 Enhancement)

# 

# \- All QCity and QMOI activities (automation, error fixing, AI/ML, dashboard, etc.) are now offloaded to Colab, Dagshub, and cloud environments. Local device resources are never used for heavy or critical tasks; only UI and user interactions run locally.

# \- QMOI exclusively uses its own cloned GitLab and Gitpod platforms, which are more advanced and optimized than the actual ones. Actual GitLab/Gitpod are never used for automation, CI/CD, or development.

# \- All jobs, runners, and pipelines are managed by QMOI's cloud/Colab/Dagshub infrastructure for maximum scalability, reliability, and speed.

# \- See also: QMOIAVATAR.md, QMOIAICORE.md, QMOIAUTOEVOLVE.md, CMDCOMMANDS.md, .gitlab-ci.yml, and all .md docs for cross-platform and cloud-offloading details.
