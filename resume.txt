QMOI-ENHANCED - RESUME

Purpose
-------
This file summarizes the current workspace state, what automated tooling is available, and step-by-step instructions for a human or an automated agent to continue work in another Codespace without losing progress.

Quick status
------------
- Branch: autosync/enhancements
- Last automated commits: multiple parser-safe fixes, API.md regeneration, model-card generation.
- Backup/Push tooling: scripts/push_all.py and scripts/push_all.sh (create backups, commit and push numbered commits).

How to preserve and transfer work (non-technical)
-----------------------------------------------
1. Save your work in this Codespace by running the simple backup-and-push script:

   - Open a terminal in this Codespace and run:

     ```bash
     bash scripts/push_all.sh --message "manual save"
     ```

   - This will:
     - Create a timestamped backup under `.push_backups/` (unless you pass `--skip-backup`).
     - Stage all changes, commit them with an automatic incremented commit message like `push 1: manual save` and push to the current GitHub branch.

2. Confirm on GitHub that your branch `autosync/enhancements` has the latest commit.

3. Open a new Codespace or machine, clone the repository, and checkout branch `autosync/enhancements`:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thealphakenya/qmoi-enhanced.git
   cd qmoi-enhanced
   git checkout autosync/enhancements
   ```

4. If you need to restore a backup from `.push_backups/` (rare): download the backup tarball from the repository's branch or ask the previous Codespace user to provide the file.


How to use the automated tools (for agents/non-technical)
--------------------------------------------------------
- `scripts/push_all.sh [--skip-backup] [--force] [--message "summary"]`
  - Use this to reliably snapshot, commit and push local changes. Each successful push is numbered (push 1, push 2...).

- `tools/update_model_card_fixed.py --metadata <path> --out QMOI_MODEL_CARD.md`
  - Use to update the model card from autodev metadata.

- `tools/generate_api_md.py --out API.md`
  - Regenerates `API.md` by scanning code for API endpoints.


Troubleshooting
---------------
- If `git push` fails due to conflicts: pull remote changes first (`git pull --rebase origin autosync/enhancements`) then re-run the push script.
- If a commit fails, the push script will attempt a soft reset to avoid leaving you with unpushed commits; inspect `git status` and re-run push script.
- If you see syntax errors in Python files, run `python -m py_compile <file>` to check; the automation uses conservative edits to avoid breaking the repo.


Guidance for maintainers (technical)
-----------------------------------
1. Keep `.auto-sync-ignore` up to date with vendor directories and problematic files (null-bytes, huge archives) to avoid noisy auto-fixes.
2. To automatically run the model-card updater after a build, add a CI step that runs:

   ```bash
   python tools/update_model_card_fixed.py --metadata qvillage/registry/qmoi/<version>/metadata.json --out QMOI_MODEL_CARD.md
   git add QMOI_MODEL_CARD.md && git commit -m "chore: update model card for <version>" && git push
   ```

3. For JS/TS autofix: install Node 18+, then run ESLint/Prettier in a scoped manner and commit changes with the push script.


Next steps (recommended)
------------------------
1. Run `bash scripts/push_all.sh --message "auto-save before next automated edits"` to snapshot and push the current workspace.
2. Run tests (enable `RUN_TESTS=true` in automation) and triage failures in small batches.
3. Wire `tools/update_model_card_fixed.py` into the autodev CI pipeline.

Enhanced TODO tracking
----------------------
The repository now tracks local helper todo items in `resume.txt` to make handoffs easier. Each item has: status [not-started|in-progress|completed], owner (optional), and a short description.

- [in-progress] Run push script to push all changes — use `bash scripts/push_all.sh --message "merge resume and add push scripts"` (this will create a backup in `.push_backups/`).
- [not-started] Re-run scoped `py_compile` and `black` on tracked Python files (exclude `.auto-sync-ignore`) and list failing files.
- [not-started] Fix top 1-3 non-vendored failing Python files (atomic edits, commit/push per fix).
- [not-started] Scan for JS/TS files and run ESLint/Prettier in a scoped manner, commit fixes with push script.
- [not-started] Enable `RUN_TESTS=true` and run CI tests; triage failures in small batches.

Merged txr notes
----------------
The separate `resume.txr` has been merged into this file and will be deleted. It contained the same instructions in a machine-friendly format and a short key/notes section. If you need the txr format again I'll recreate it.

Contact & notes
---------------
If anything goes wrong, check `.push_backups/` for recent snapshots and the git history on `autosync/enhancements`.
Resume - QMOI Enhanced Work & Roadmap

Date: 2025-10-15
Branch: autosync/enhancements

Summary of recent work
- Implemented scoped auto-fix automation and safety controls (.auto-sync-ignore, RUN_TESTS flag, AUTO_FIX_PATHS).
- Replaced several corrupted or parse-failing scripts with parser-safe, minimal implementations:
  - scripts/qmoi-git-auto.py (git automation helper)
  - scripts/qmoi-real-time-logger.py (minimal JSONL + SQLite logger)
  - scripts/qmoi-dashboard-enhance.py (indentation and robustness fixes)
  - scripts/qmoi_dashboard.py (minimal Flask dashboard stub)
- Manually remediated and reformatted `qmoi-enhanced/scripts/models/qmoi_autodev.py` to fix indentation and syntax errors.
- Updated `.auto-sync-ignore` to exclude vendored/non-repo files (e.g., Python-3.12.3/) and problematic binary files.
- Created scoped auto-sync commits on `autosync/enhancements` for each successful fix (commits include scoped formatting and pushes to origin).

Current status
- Todo: Manual remediation of remaining parse-failing files is in-progress. Initial repo-wide scan showed multiple failures (null-byte/binary files, vendored CPython test tree, duplicate script paths, and a set of repo scripts requiring manual fixes).
- The `qmoi_autodev.py` file now parses and has been committed.

Immediate next steps
1. Re-run a scoped py_compile/Black scan across tracked Python files (excluding `.auto-sync-ignore`) to produce an updated list of failing files.
2. Fix remaining non-vendored Python files in small batches (atomic replacement or localized edits): compile → format → commit/push.
3. After Python cleanup, run ESLint/Prettier on selected JS/TS files (scoped), commit fixes.
4. Enable RUN_TESTS=true and run the test suite; triage failing tests and fix iteratively.
5. Prepare a final PR from `autosync/enhancements` to `main` once stable.

Comprehensive enhancement plan for Qmoi & Qvillage (high-level)
- Architecture & Model
  - Adopt a modular transformer backbone with LoRA/adapters and MoE options. Provide quantized builds for edge.
  - Implement RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) and evaluator agents for safe updates.
  - Version, benchmark, and store artifacts in Qvillage registry.

- Platform & Services (Qvillage)
  - Model hub, spaces (demos), pipelines, search & tags, version control, and evaluator/auto-quantization services.
  - RBAC, quotas, analytics, private/public model controls.

- UI / UX
  - Unified chat & developer console: single interface with modes (Fast/Balanced/Accurate), model diagnostics, retrieval citations, and developer tools.
  - Multi-platform support: web, mobile, desktop (Electron), IDE extensions, and browser extensions.

- Safety & Governance
  - Governance board, public model cards, transparent changelogs, opt-in analytics, PII protections, red-team testing.

- Developer Experience
  - APIs (generate/embed/classify/upload/evaluate/deploy), SDKs, plugin system, and CI/CD model pipelines.

- Testing & Reliability
  - Unit/integration/perf/safety/regression tests, auto-benchmarks, and gating before promotion.

Key documentation & files to update
- All `.md` files mentioning Qmoi (Qmoi model, Qvillage, Qmoi auto dev, errors, auto research, independent features, Qmoi IDE, QCity, Qmoi Space, extensions).
- `API.md` — produce a complete inventory of endpoints and their usage patterns.
- Model card(s) for Qmoi (ready-to-fill template and example metrics).
- README additions describing the auto-update pipeline and governance.
- Tests documentation and auto-test runbooks.

Deliverables I will prepare next (pick an order)
1. Run repo-wide py_compile scan and list failing files (filtered). (Recommended first)
2. Automated: Fix the top 1-3 non-vendored failing Python files, commit incrementally.
3. Produce a ready-to-fill `QMOI_MODEL_CARD.md` and `Qvillage_README.md` templates.
4. Draft an `API.md` augment listing discovered endpoints and where they live. 
5. Produce a UI spec (React/Tailwind skeleton) for the unified chat & developer console.

Notes & constraints
- Some repository files are vendored (Python-3.12.3 test tree) or binary/null-byte files; these should remain in `.auto-sync-ignore` or be removed intentionally by maintainers.
- I will avoid broad, repository-wide formatting commits; work will be done in small, audited batches.

If you'd like, I can now:
- Run the py_compile scan and start fixing the next batch of files, or
- Generate the `QMOI_MODEL_CARD.md` template and an initial `API.md` draft.

Quick start for someone who doesn't know Git or Codespaces (step-by-step)
1. Open the Codespace workspace in your browser or VS Code.
2. To save everything and push to GitHub (so you can continue later in another Codespace):
  - Open a terminal in the workspace (Terminal → New Terminal).
  - Run the push helper (this creates a backup and pushes changes):

```bash
./scripts/push_all.sh
```

  - If you want to skip the backup (not recommended):

```bash
./scripts/push_all.sh --no-backup
```

  - If you are comfortable and want to force the remote to match this workspace (use carefully):

```bash
./scripts/push_all.sh --force
```

3. To continue work in another Codespace or machine:
  - Clone the repo at `https://github.com/thealphakenya/qmoi-enhanced.git` using your account with access.
  - Checkout the branch `autosync/enhancements`:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout autosync/enhancements
git pull origin autosync/enhancements
```

4. If you get merge conflicts while pulling, open the conflicting files in the editor, inspect the sections marked with `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>`, accept either version or merge manually, then run:

```bash
git add <fixed-files>
git commit -m "resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin autosync/enhancements
```

5. To run the model-card updater locally (after builds produce metadata):

```bash
python tools/update_model_card_fixed.py --metadata qvillage/registry/qmoi/v0.0.1/metadata.json --out QMOI_MODEL_CARD.md
```

6. For automated CI/test runs the repo uses a flag `RUN_TESTS`. To run tests locally:

```bash
export RUN_TESTS=true
./ci/tests.sh
```

Troubleshooting tips
- If `git push` fails with authentication errors, ensure your Codespace has proper GitHub access or set up a Personal Access Token (PAT) and use `git remote set-url origin https://<token>@github.com/thealphakenya/qmoi-enhanced.git` temporarily.
- If the backup creation fails, check available disk space. Backups are saved under `.push_backups/`.
- If Python scripts fail with "null bytes" or syntax errors, those files are likely corrupted; ask me to fix the next batch of failures.
