Resume - QMOI Enhanced Work & Roadmap

Date: 2025-10-15
Branch: autosync/enhancements

Summary of recent work
- Implemented scoped auto-fix automation and safety controls (.auto-sync-ignore, RUN_TESTS flag, AUTO_FIX_PATHS).
- Replaced several corrupted or parse-failing scripts with parser-safe, minimal implementations:
  - scripts/qmoi-git-auto.py (git automation helper)
  - scripts/qmoi-real-time-logger.py (minimal JSONL + SQLite logger)
  - scripts/qmoi-dashboard-enhance.py (indentation and robustness fixes)
  - scripts/qmoi_dashboard.py (minimal Flask dashboard stub)
- Manually remediated and reformatted `qmoi-enhanced/scripts/models/qmoi_autodev.py` to fix indentation and syntax errors.
- Updated `.auto-sync-ignore` to exclude vendored/non-repo files (e.g., Python-3.12.3/) and problematic binary files.
- Created scoped auto-sync commits on `autosync/enhancements` for each successful fix (commits include scoped formatting and pushes to origin).

Current status
- Todo: Manual remediation of remaining parse-failing files is in-progress. Initial repo-wide scan showed multiple failures (null-byte/binary files, vendored CPython test tree, duplicate script paths, and a set of repo scripts requiring manual fixes).
- The `qmoi_autodev.py` file now parses and has been committed.

Immediate next steps
1. Re-run a scoped py_compile/Black scan across tracked Python files (excluding `.auto-sync-ignore`) to produce an updated list of failing files.
2. Fix remaining non-vendored Python files in small batches (atomic replacement or localized edits): compile → format → commit/push.
3. After Python cleanup, run ESLint/Prettier on selected JS/TS files (scoped), commit fixes.
4. Enable RUN_TESTS=true and run the test suite; triage failing tests and fix iteratively.
5. Prepare a final PR from `autosync/enhancements` to `main` once stable.

Comprehensive enhancement plan for Qmoi & Qvillage (high-level)
- Architecture & Model
  - Adopt a modular transformer backbone with LoRA/adapters and MoE options. Provide quantized builds for edge.
  - Implement RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) and evaluator agents for safe updates.
  - Version, benchmark, and store artifacts in Qvillage registry.

- Platform & Services (Qvillage)
  - Model hub, spaces (demos), pipelines, search & tags, version control, and evaluator/auto-quantization services.
  - RBAC, quotas, analytics, private/public model controls.

- UI / UX
  - Unified chat & developer console: single interface with modes (Fast/Balanced/Accurate), model diagnostics, retrieval citations, and developer tools.
  - Multi-platform support: web, mobile, desktop (Electron), IDE extensions, and browser extensions.

- Safety & Governance
  - Governance board, public model cards, transparent changelogs, opt-in analytics, PII protections, red-team testing.

- Developer Experience
  - APIs (generate/embed/classify/upload/evaluate/deploy), SDKs, plugin system, and CI/CD model pipelines.

- Testing & Reliability
  - Unit/integration/perf/safety/regression tests, auto-benchmarks, and gating before promotion.

Key documentation & files to update
- All `.md` files mentioning Qmoi (Qmoi model, Qvillage, Qmoi auto dev, errors, auto research, independent features, Qmoi IDE, QCity, Qmoi Space, extensions).
- `API.md` — produce a complete inventory of endpoints and their usage patterns.
- Model card(s) for Qmoi (ready-to-fill template and example metrics).
- README additions describing the auto-update pipeline and governance.
- Tests documentation and auto-test runbooks.

Deliverables I will prepare next (pick an order)
1. Run repo-wide py_compile scan and list failing files (filtered). (Recommended first)
2. Automated: Fix the top 1-3 non-vendored failing Python files, commit incrementally.
3. Produce a ready-to-fill `QMOI_MODEL_CARD.md` and `Qvillage_README.md` templates.
4. Draft an `API.md` augment listing discovered endpoints and where they live. 
5. Produce a UI spec (React/Tailwind skeleton) for the unified chat & developer console.

Notes & constraints
- Some repository files are vendored (Python-3.12.3 test tree) or binary/null-byte files; these should remain in `.auto-sync-ignore` or be removed intentionally by maintainers.
- I will avoid broad, repository-wide formatting commits; work will be done in small, audited batches.

If you'd like, I can now:
- Run the py_compile scan and start fixing the next batch of files, or
- Generate the `QMOI_MODEL_CARD.md` template and an initial `API.md` draft.

Quick start for someone who doesn't know Git or Codespaces (step-by-step)
1. Open the Codespace workspace in your browser or VS Code.
2. To save everything and push to GitHub (so you can continue later in another Codespace):
  - Open a terminal in the workspace (Terminal → New Terminal).
  - Run the push helper (this creates a backup and pushes changes):

```bash
./scripts/push_all.sh
```

  - If you want to skip the backup (not recommended):

```bash
./scripts/push_all.sh --no-backup
```

  - If you are comfortable and want to force the remote to match this workspace (use carefully):

```bash
./scripts/push_all.sh --force
```

3. To continue work in another Codespace or machine:
  - Clone the repo at `https://github.com/thealphakenya/qmoi-enhanced.git` using your account with access.
  - Checkout the branch `autosync/enhancements`:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout autosync/enhancements
git pull origin autosync/enhancements
```

4. If you get merge conflicts while pulling, open the conflicting files in the editor, inspect the sections marked with `<<<<<<<` and `>>>>>>>`, accept either version or merge manually, then run:

```bash
git add <fixed-files>
git commit -m "resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin autosync/enhancements
```

5. To run the model-card updater locally (after builds produce metadata):

```bash
python tools/update_model_card_fixed.py --metadata qvillage/registry/qmoi/v0.0.1/metadata.json --out QMOI_MODEL_CARD.md
```

6. For automated CI/test runs the repo uses a flag `RUN_TESTS`. To run tests locally:

```bash
export RUN_TESTS=true
./ci/tests.sh
```

Troubleshooting tips
- If `git push` fails with authentication errors, ensure your Codespace has proper GitHub access or set up a Personal Access Token (PAT) and use `git remote set-url origin https://<token>@github.com/thealphakenya/qmoi-enhanced.git` temporarily.
- If the backup creation fails, check available disk space. Backups are saved under `.push_backups/`.
- If Python scripts fail with "null bytes" or syntax errors, those files are likely corrupted; ask me to fix the next batch of failures.
