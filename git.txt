# Git Automation Reference

All git operations (commit, push, pull, error-fix, notifications) are now handled by the new QMOI automation system:

- `scripts/qmoi-auto-push.js`
- `scripts/auto-git-update.js`
- `scripts/qmoi-qcity-automatic.py`
- `scripts/qmoi-enhanced-master-automation.py`
- `scripts/qmoi_notification_manager.py`

## Usage
- All changes are auto-staged, committed, and pushed on schedule and on file changes.
- Pulls and merges are handled automatically.
- All errors are auto-fixed and retried.
- Notifications are sent to all configured channels.
- All actions are logged and visible in the QCity dashboard (master-only).
