# ENDPOINTS.md - Consolidated Endpoint Map

## Purpose
This document lists the endpoint families used by the QMOI system and the repository automation stack.

## Endpoint Inventory

The Ollama autonomous agent must treat the following operational endpoints as part of the merge and automation contract:

- /agent/merge-history
- /agent/reconcile-markdown
- /agent/scan-archive
- /agent/validate-ui-styles
- /agent/validate-user-auth
- /agent/sync-documentation
- /agent/validate-routes
- /agent/validate-ports
- /agent/validate-history

These endpoints ensure that merge activity, markdown inventory validation, UI styling checks, route and port validation, and historical archive reconciliation are all part of the same operational process. The agent should always verify against the active repo first and then compare against [qmoi-enhanced-history-14](qmoi-enhanced-history-14) for missing or recovered implementation logic.

### Core System

### File and History Inventory
- /files/index
- /files/markdown

- /history/archives
- /history/snapshots

## Notes
This document is the canonical operational endpoint registry for the repository and its historical snapshots, and it must remain aligned with the live automation, GitHub dispatchers, and cross-repo agent implementation.
