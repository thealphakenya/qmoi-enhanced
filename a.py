# QMOI Automation & Platform Independence Summary
#
# - All automation, CI/CD, error fixing, and updates are executed in QMOI's cloned, enhanced platforms (never the actual GitLab, GitHub, Vercel, etc.).
# - All heavy tasks are offloaded to Colab, Dagshub, or cloud runners for maximum performance, reliability, and scalability.
# - The QMOI dashboard provides real-time logs, reports, pre-autotest results, notification status, and master-only controls.
# - Multi-platform pre-autotest logic ensures all fixes/updates are only applied if all platforms pass permission and test checks.
# - Retry and fallback logic guarantees pipeline success, with master override for any failed stage.
# - All .md docs and .gitlab-ci.yml are always updated to reflect the latest automation, dashboard, and notification enhancements.
# - QMOI is always-on, self-healing, cloud-offloaded, and fully master-controlled.
