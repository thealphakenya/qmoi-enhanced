## Overview
QMOI is designed to maximize use of free-tier and open-source features across all platforms. It automatically detects, avoids, and replaces any feature that requires payment or a subscription, ensuring all automation, deployments, and integrations work without cost.

---

## Features
- **Free-Tier Enforcement:** QMOI scans all platforms and APIs for paid features and avoids them.
- **Feature Cloning:** If a paid feature is required, QMOI clones or uses an open/free alternative.
- **Open-Source First:** Always prefers open-source or self-hosted tools/services.
- **Notification:** Notifies the master if a paid feature is detected and what alternative is used.
- **Automation:** All automation, deployments, and integrations are designed to work without payment or subscription.

---

## How It Works
- QMOI checks all API calls, scripts, and integrations for payment requirements.
- If a paid feature is detected, QMOI automatically switches to a free/open alternative.
- All actions and substitutions are logged and visible to the master.
