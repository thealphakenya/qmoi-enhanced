- Serve via Python/Node.js web server (search for main server script or use FastAPI/Flask/Express)
- UI features: Referenced in `QCITYRESOURCES.md`, `QCITYRUNNERSENGINE.md`, and `QCITYQMOIAUTOSTART.md`
- All endpoints and UI features are autotested and autofixed by QMOI

## QMOI AI Serving
- Main entry: `qmoi_ai.py`, `qmoi_ai_launcher.py`, `main.py` (if present)
- Serve via Python backend (FastAPI/Flask)
- UI features: Referenced in `QMOI-ENHANCED-FEATURES.md`, `QMOI-ENHANCED-AUTOTESTS.md`, and `QMOI_MEMORY.md`

- Errors detected in any app or browser are autofixed automatically
- All serving and autofix features are referenced and documented for permanent operation

## Error Handling & Debugging
- All serving errors and issues are logged in SERVINGERRORSISSUES.md in real time
- Terminal output and debugging information are referenced for autofix and enhancement
- QMOI uses this log to locate, fix, and enhance all serving issues
