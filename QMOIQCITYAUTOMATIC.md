# QMOI QCity Automatic System

## üöÄ Overview

The QMOI QCity Automatic System is a comprehensive automation platform that provides continuous monitoring, automatic GitLab CI/CD triggering, real-time visualization, and self-healing capabilities. The system runs continuously and automatically manages all aspects of the QMOI QCity platform.

## üì¶ App Download & QI Integration
- **Device-Aware Download:** QI download is device-aware, feature-selectable, and always provides the correct, up-to-date installer.
- **Download is only possible if all health checks and autotests pass.**
- **Apps are always up to date, error-free, and auto-updating after install.**

### DNS & Download Link Auto-Resolution
- **DNS Auto-Check & Fix:** QMOI QCity Automatic now automatically checks and fixes DNS for all download links (downloads.qmoi.app). If DNS fails, it triggers an auto-fix routine, notifies master/admin, and logs all actions.
- **Zero-Rated & Fallback Links:** If DNS cannot be fixed immediately, QMOI QCity Automatic auto-switches to zero-rated or fallback CDN links (see ZERORATEDQMOI.md) to ensure downloads always work.
- **Freenom Fallback:** If DNS cannot be fixed, QMOI QCity Automatic auto-registers a free fallback domain via Freenom, updates all download links, and ensures downloads remain available. All actions are logged and master/admin is notified.
- **Integrated Pipeline Automation:** All Freenom fallback, DNS automation, and link update logic is integrated into the QCity Automatic pipeline (.gitlab-ci.yml), so every automation cycle includes DNS health checks, fallback domain creation, and link updates as needed. All actions are logged and visible in the QCity dashboard.
- **Dashboard Integration:** Master can view DNS/link health and trigger manual checks from the dashboard.
- **Full Automation:** All DNS and link health checks, fixes, and fallback logic are fully automated and require no manual intervention.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration & Logging
- All health checks, autotests, and error fixing are logged to QCity and visible in the dashboard (master-only).
- All .md docs are always up to date and reflect the latest automation and monitoring enhancements.

## üèÉ QCity Runners Engine
- See `QCITYRUNNERSENGINE.md` for full details on self-hosted, self-healing, ever-evolving runners.

## ü§ñ Self-Healing & Auto-Fix Enhancements (2025+)

- **Unicode-Safe Logging:** All logs are now UTF-8 safe and auto-sanitize messages to prevent Unicode errors, even on Windows.
- **Subprocess Command Checks:** Before running any automation or fix command, QMOI checks if the command exists and auto-installs or repairs as needed.
- **Config Auto-Repair:** If any required config key (like 'platforms') is missing, QMOI auto-initializes it and repairs the config file on the fly.
- **General Auto-Fix Routine:** QMOI scans for missing files, keys, or dependencies and auto-creates, installs, or initializes them as needed, logging all actions.
- **Robust Subprocess Error Handling:** All automation and fix routines now check for failed or None subprocesses before accessing results, preventing 'NoneType' errors and providing clear diagnostics for failed commands.
- **Next.js & Dependency Auto-Upgrade:** QMOI automatically checks for outdated Next.js and upgrades to the latest version, ensuring the platform is always up to date.
- **All enhancements are fully automated and require no manual intervention.**

## üü¢ Live Status & Real-Time Monitoring

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting: No Billing Account, Quota, or Hosted Runner Issues

**QMOI's self-hosted runners and independent automation system fully bypass all billing, quota, and hosted runner restrictions.**

- No external CI/CD billing or quota issues will ever block your automation, builds, or deployments.
- All actions are performed on your own infrastructure, with no dependency on external platform billing or quotas.
- For full details, see: QCITYRUNNERSENGINE.md, INDEPENDENTQMOI.md, QMOICLONE.md.
