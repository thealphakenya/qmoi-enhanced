# QMOI Extension: Revenue Automation & Self-Evolution

## Overview
QMOI Extension is a self-evolving, revenue-generating AI agent that auto-creates all required files, settings, and UI in any workspace, codespace, or platform. It is always available, even offline, and can:
- Automate revenue streams (ads, SaaS, licensing, affiliate, etc.)
- Manage employment, business logic, and automation
- Evolve and add/modify features automatically
- Register itself in all extension/plugin sections
- Provide master-only access to advanced controls

## Auto-Generated Files
- `qmoi.json`: Core settings, platforms, and features

- UI panels, chat, and themes auto-injected on activation

## Revenue Features
