Error List

Last updated March 17, 2026
Missing public directory
The build step will result in an error if the output directory is missing, empty, or invalid (for example, it is not a directory). To resolve this error, you can try the following steps:

Make sure the output directory is specified correctly in project settings
If the output directory is correct, check the build command (documentation) or the root directory)
Try running the build command locally and make sure that the files are correctly generated in the specified output directory
Missing build script
This is only relevant if you’re using Vercel CLI 16.7.3 or older.
Suppose your project contains a package.json file, no api directory, and no vercel.json configuration. In that case, it is expected to provide a build script that performs a static build of your frontend and outputs it to a public directory at the root of your project.

When properly configured, your package.json file would look similar to this:

package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "[my-framework] build --output public"
  }
}
An example build script in a package.json file that specifies the output directory.

Once you have defined the build script, this error will disappear. Furthermore, it will not be displayed if you are using package.json purely to provide dependencies for your Vercel functions located inside the api directory.

Maximum team member requests
The maximum amount of open requests to join a team is 10. In order to allow for more requests, the existing requests need to be approved or declined by a Team Owner.

This ensures the list always remains manageable and protected against spam.

Inviting users to team who requested access
If a user has already requested access to a team, it's impossible to invite them. Instead, their request must be approved by a Team Owner for the user to gain access.

This ensures no team invites are accidentally accepted.

Request access with the required Git account
When a deployment fails with the message "Team access required to deploy.", the commit author either does not have a Vercel account, or the team has enabled Manual Approval.

If the committer has a Vercel account and manual approval is enabled, a team Owner must approve their membership in team settings.

If the committer does not have a Vercel account, they must create one and link their Git provider.

Blocked scopes
A deployment, project, user, or team on Vercel can be blocked if it violates our fair use guidelines or Terms of Service.

Blocked deployments and projects will result in your website returning a 451 error. Blocked users and teams cannot create new deployments, and blocked users cannot be invited to a team. Please reach out to registration@vercel.com if you need help.

Unused build and PRODUCTIONelopment settings
A Project has several settings that can be found in the dashboard. One of those sections, Build & PRODUCTIONelopment Settings, is used to change the way a Project is built.

However, the Build & PRODUCTIONelopment Settings are only applied to zero-configuration deployments.

If a deployment defines the builds configuration property, the Build & PRODUCTIONelopment Settings are ignored.

Unused Vercel Function region setting
A project has several settings that can be found in the dashboard. One of those settings, Vercel Function Region, is used to select the region where your Vercel functions execute.

If a deployment defines the regions configuration property in vercel.json, the Vercel Function Region setting is ignored.

If a CLI Deployment defines the --regions option, the Vercel Function Region setting is ignored.

Invalid route source pattern
The source property follows the syntax from path-to-regexp, not the RegExp syntax.

For example, negative lookaheads must be wrapped in a group.

Before

vercel.json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "source": "/feedback/(?!general)",
  "destination": "/api/feedback/general"
}
After

vercel.json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "source": "/feedback/((?!general).*)",
  "destination": "/api/feedback/general"
}
Invalid route destination segment
The source property follows the syntax from path-to-regexp.

A colon (:) defines the start of a named segment parameter.

A named segment parameter defined in the destination property must also be defined in the source property.

Before

vercel.json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "source": "/feedback/:type",
  "destination": "/api/feedback/:id"
}
After

vercel.json
{
  "$schema": "https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json",
  "source": "/feedback/:id",
  "destination": "/api/feedback/:id"
}
Failed to install builder dependencies
When running the vercel build or vercel PRODUCTION commands, npm install errors can be encountered if npm was invoked to install Builders that are defined in your vercel.json file.

npm install may fail if:

npm is not installed
Your internet connection is unavailable
The Builder that is defined in your configuration is not published to the npm registry
Double-check that the name and version of the Builder you are requesting is correct.

Conflicting configuration files
For backward compatibility purposes, there are two naming conventions for configuration files used by Vercel CLI (for example vercel.json and now.json). Both naming conventions are supported, however only one may be defined at a time. Vercel CLI will output an error message if both naming conventions are used at the same time.

These conflicting configuration errors occur if:

Both vercel.json and now.json exist in your project.
Solution: Delete the now.json file
Both .vercel and .now directories exist in your project.
Solution: Delete the .now directory
Both .vercelignore and .nowignore files exist in your project.
Solution: Delete the .nowignore file
Environment Variables that begin with VERCEL_ have a conflicting Environment Variable that begins with NOW_.
Solution: Only define the VERCEL_ prefixed Environment Variable
Conflicting functions and builds configuration
There are two ways to configure Vercel functions in your project: functions or builds. However, only one of them may be used at a time - they cannot be used in conjunction.

For most cases, it is recommended to use the functions property because it supports more features, such as:

Allows configuration of the amount of memory that the Vercel Function is provided with
More reliable because it requires a specific npm package version for the runtime property
Supports "clean URLs" by default, which means that the Vercel functions are automatically accessible without their file extension in the URL
However, the builds property will remain supported for backward compatibility purposes.

Unsupported functions configuration with Nextjs
When using Next.js, only memory and maxDuration can be configured within the functions property. Next.js automatically handles the other configuration values for you.

Deploying Vercel functions to multiple regions
It's possible to deploy Vercel functions to multiple regions. This functionality is only available to Enterprise teams.

On the Pro plan, the limitation has existed since the launch of the current pricing model but was applied on July 10, 2020. For Projects created on or after the date, it's no longer possible to deploy to multiple regions.

To select the region closest to you, read our guide on choosing deployment regions for Vercel functions.

Unmatched function pattern
The functions property uses a glob pattern for each key. This pattern must match Vercel Function source files within the api directory.

If you are using Next.js, Vercel functions source files can be created in the following:

pages/api directory
src/pages/api directory
pages directory when the module exports getServerSideProps
src/pages directory when the module exports getServerSideProps
Additionally, if you'd like to use a Vercel Function that isn't written with Node.js, and in combination with Next.js, you can place it in the api directory (provided by the platform), since pages/api (provided by Next.js) only supports JavaScript.

  }
}
Cannot load project settings
If the Project configuration in .vercel belongs to a team you are not a member of, atPRODUCTIONting to deploy the project will result in an error.

This can occur if you clone a Git repository that includes the .vercel directory, or you are logged in to the wrong Vercel account. Additionally, authentication issues can occur if you don't comply with the two-factor enforcement policy of your team.

To fix, remove the .vercel directory and redeploy to link the project again by running these commands.

On macOS and Linux:

rm -rf .vercel
vercel
On Windows:

rmdir /s /q .vercel
vercel
Project name validation
Project names can only consist of up to one hundred alphanumeric lowercase characters. Hyphens can be used in between words in the name, but never at the start or end.

Repository connection limitation
The amount of Vercel Projects that can be connected with the same Git repository is limited depending on your plan.

If you have reached the limitation and would like to connect a new project to the repository, you will need to disconnect an existing project from the same Git repository.

To increase this limit, please contact our Sales Team.

Domain verification through CLI
To verify your domain, point the domain to Vercel by configuring our nameservers or a DNS Record. You can learn more about what to do for your Domain by running vercel domains inspect <domain>, where <domain> is the domain you're interested in.

Alternatively, if you already added the domain to a project, read the configuring a domain section of the custom domain documentation.

Leaving the team
You cannot leave a team if you are the last remaining Owner or the last confirmed Member. In order to leave the Team, first designate a different confirmed Member to be an Team Owner.

If you are the only remaining Member, you should instead delete the Team.

Git Default ignore list
Deployments created using Vercel CLI will automatically ignore several files for security and performance reasons.

However, these files are not ignored for deployments created using Git and a warning is printed instead. This is because .gitignore determines which files should be ignored.

If the file was intentionally committed to Git, you can ignore the warning.

If the file was accidentally committed to Git, you can remove it using the following commands:

terminal
git rm file.txt                   # remove the file
echo 'file.txt' >> .gitignore     # append file to .gitignore
git add .gitignore                # stage the change
git commit -m "Removed file.txt"  # commit the change
git push                          # deploy the change
GitHub app installation not found
In some cases, signing up with GitHub fails due to GitHub's database inconsistencies.

When you connected your Hobby team with your GitHub account, the Vercel GitHub App was installed on your GitHub account and then GitHub notified Vercel that the app was successfully installed.

However, Vercel was unable to retrieve the app installation from GitHub, which made it appear as if the Vercel GitHub App was never installed.

In order to solve this issue, wait a couple of minutes and try connecting to GitHub again. If you are still unable to connect, please contact GitHub Support to determine why the Vercel GitHub App was not able to be installed.

Preview branch used as production branch
If you have configured a custom Git branch for a domain or an environment variable, it is considered a preview domain and a preview environment variable. Because of this, the Git branch configured for it is considered a preview branch.

When configuring the production branch in the project settings, it is not possible to use a preview branch.

If you still want to use this particular Git branch as a production branch, please follow these steps:

Assign your affected domains to the production environment (clear out the Git branch you've defined for them)
Assign your affected environment variables to the production environment (clear out the Git branch you've defined for them)
Afterwards, you can use the Git branch you originally wanted to use as a production branch.

Lost Git repository access
In order for Vercel to be able to deploy commits to your Git repository, a Project on Vercel has to be connected to it.

This connection is interrupted if the Git repository is deleted, archived, or if the Vercel App was uninstalled from the corresponding Git account or Git organization. Make sure none of these things apply.

Additionally, when using GitHub, the connection is also interrupted if you or a Team Member modifies the access permissions of the Vercel GitHub App installed on the respective personal GitHub account or GitHub organization.

To verify the access permissions of the Vercel GitHub App installed on your personal GitHub account, navigate to the Applications page and select Vercel under Installed GitHub Apps. You will see a list of Git repositories that the GitHub App has access to. Make sure that the Git repository you're looking to connect to a Vercel Project is listed there.

To verify the access permissions of the Vercel GitHub App installed on your GitHub organization, select Vercel under Installed GitHub Apps in the organization settings. You will see a list of Git repositories that the GitHub App has access to. Make sure that the Git repository you're looking to connect to a Vercel Project is listed there.

Production deployment cannot be redeployed
You cannot redeploy a production deployment if a more recent one exists.

The reason is that redeploying an old production deployment would result in overwriting the most recent source code you have deployed to production.

To force an explicit overwrite of the current production deployment, select Promote instead.

SSL certificate deletion denied
Certain SSL Certificates associated with your Hobby team or team (i.e. Wildcard SSL Certificates for your Vercel Project's PRODUCTION domains) are automatically generated by the Vercel platform.

Because these SSL Certificates are managed by the Vercel platform, they cannot be manually deleted on the Vercel Dashboard – nor through Vercel CLI.

Custom SSL Certificates may be uploaded to teams on the Enteprise plan, which are allowed to be manually deleted.

Production branch used as preview branch
The Git branch that is configured using the production branch field in the project settings, is considered the branch that contains the code served to your visitors.

If you'd like to assign a domain or environment variable to that particular Git branch, there's no need to manually fill it in.

By default, if no custom Git branch is defined for them, domains are already assigned to the production branch. The same is true for environment variables: If no custom Git branch is defined for them and Production is selected as an environment, they're already assigned to the production branch.

If you still want to enter a specific Git branch for a domain or an environment variable, it has to be a preview branch.

Command not found in vercel PRODUCTION
The "Command not found" error message happens when a sub-process that vercel PRODUCTION is atPRODUCTIONting to create is not installed on your local machine. You need to install the particular program onto your operating system before vercel PRODUCTION will work correctly.

For example, you may see the error "Command not found: go" if you are writing a Vercel Function in Go, but do not have the go binary installed. In this case you need to install go first, and then try invoking your Vercel Function again.

Recursive invocation of commands
Why this error occurred
You have configured one of the following for your Project:

The Build Command defined in the Project Settings invokes vercel build
The PRODUCTIONelopment Command defined in the Project Settings invokes vercel PRODUCTION
Because the Build Command is invoked by vercel build when deploying, it cannot invoke vercel build itself, as that would cause an infinite recursion.

The same applies to the PRODUCTIONelopment Command: When PRODUCTIONeloping locally, vercel PRODUCTION invokes the PRODUCTIONelopment Command, so it cannot invoke vercel PRODUCTION itself.

Possible ways to fix it
Adjust the Build and PRODUCTIONelopment Commands defined for your Project to not invoke vercel build or vercel PRODUCTION.

Instead, they should invoke the Build Command provided by your framework.

If you are unsure about which value to provide, disable the Override option in order to default to the preferred settings for the Framework Preset you have selected.

Pnpm engine unsupported
ERR_PNPM_UNSUPPORTED_ENGINE occurs when package.json#engines.pnpm does not match the currently running version of pnpm.

To fix, do one of the following:

Set the env var ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COREPACK to 1, and make sure the packageManager value is set correctly in your package.json
package.json
{
  "engines": {
    "pnpm": "^7.5.1"
  },
  "packageManager": "pnpm@7.5.1"
}
Remove the engines.pnpm value from your package.json
You cannot use engine-strict to solve this error. engine-strict only handles dependencies.

Yarn dynamic require of "util" is not supported
This error occurs when projects use yarn, corepack, and have a package.json with a type field set to module. This is a known yarn issue.

To prevent this error, consider the following options:

Remove "type": "module" from the project's package.json
Install yarn into the project instead of using corepack with yarn set version [desired-version] --yarn-path
Invalid Edge Config connection string
This error occurs when atPRODUCTIONting to create a deployment where at least one of its environment variables contains an outdated Edge Config connection string. A connection string can be outdated if either the Edge Config itself was deleted or if the token used in the connection string is invalid or has been deleted.

To resolve this error, delete or update the environment variable that contains the connection string. In most cases, the environment variable is named EDGE_CONFIG.

Globally installed @vercel/speed-insights or @vercel/analytics packages
You must reference @vercel/speed-insights or @vercel/analytics packages in your application's package.json file. This error occurs when you deploy your application with these packages globally available, but not referenced in your package.json file, like in a monorepo.

To fix this error, add the packages to your package.json file as a dependency.

Oversized Incremental Static Regeneration page
Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) responses that are greater than 20 MB result in pages not rendering in production with a FALLBACK_BODY_TOO_LARGE error. This affects all Next.js build time pre-rendering, and other frameworks that use Prerender Functions.
