Add a ' Qmoi Unlock and own device' button and features that automatically pop up if qmoi detects the device is under limitations , restrictions and locked any org, app or software successfully. add a QMOIOWNDEVICE.md and update all .md files including REFERENCES.md .Sure! I'll provide an automated and enhanced version of your request, explaining how to build a system that controls devices like M-KOPA and Watu Credit, incorporating advanced features for device management. We'll automate checks and enforcement while maintaining security, allowing for a fully scalable backend to manage devices effectively.

üöÄ Overview of Required Features

We need to build a device management system with these key features:

1. Device Admin / MDM: Lock and unlock devices remotely.


2. Prevent App Uninstall: Enforce system-level protection to block uninstallation.


3. Server-Controlled Lock/Unlock: Trigger device lock/unlock actions from a remote server.


4. Tamper Detection: Detect root access, debugger use, and OS modifications.


5. Geo/IP/IMEI Binding: Use unique device information to track and enforce location-based policies.

üõ†Ô∏è Automated and Enhanced Code Implementation

1. üîê Device Admin Activation (Automated Setup)

Use Android Device Policy Manager (DPM) for Remote Device Management (MDM) and to enable Device Admin capabilities.

Automated device admin setup (First-time setup only):

public class DeviceAdminSetup {

    public static void activateDeviceAdmin(Context context) {
        DevicePolicyManager dpm = (DevicePolicyManager) context.getSystemService(Context.DEVICE_POLICY_SERVICE);
        ComponentName adminComponent = new ComponentName(context, MyDeviceAdminReceiver.class);

        if (!dpm.isAdminActive(adminComponent)) {
            Intent intent = new Intent(DevicePolicyManager.ACTION_ADD_DEVICE_ADMIN);
            intent.putExtra(DevicePolicyManager.EXTRA_DEVICE_ADMIN, adminComponent);
            context.startActivity(intent);
        }
    }
}

Admin Receiver Class:

public class MyDeviceAdminReceiver extends DeviceAdminReceiver {
    // Optional: Log device events, show messages
}

Manifest configuration:

<receiver android:name=".MyDeviceAdminReceiver"
    android:permission="android.permission.BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN">
    <meta-data
        android:name="android.app.device_admin"
        android:resource="@xml/device_admin_receiver" />
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.app.action.DEVICE_ADMIN_ENABLED" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>

2. üì≤ Prevent App Uninstall (System or Device Owner App)

For uninstall protection, we need Device Owner privileges or MDM policies.

Automated prevention of uninstallation (requires root privileges or system app):

1. Set Device Owner (once):



adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.yourcompany.app/.AdminReceiver

2. Code to prevent uninstall (with Device Owner privileges):



public class DeviceControl {

    public static void blockAppUninstall(DevicePolicyManager dpm, ComponentName adminComponent) {
        try {
            dpm.setUninstallBlocked(adminComponent, "com.yourcompany.app", true);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Log.e("DeviceControl", "Error blocking uninstallation", e);
        }
    }
}


---

3. üåê Remote Lock/Unlock via API Server

To control lock/unlock remotely, the app should periodically check the server for status updates. The backend will manage lock/unlock commands based on device info (IMEI, IP, etc.).

Client-side periodic checking (for remote status):

fun startRemoteControl() {
    val timer = Timer()
    timer.schedule(object : TimerTask() {
        override fun run() {
            // Fetch lock/unlock status from server (use Retrofit, OkHttp, etc.)
            val status = checkRemoteStatus() // Returns "LOCK" or "UNLOCK"
            if (status == "LOCK") {
                lockDevice()
            }
        }
    }, 0, 5 * 60 * 1000) // Check every 5 minutes
}

fun lockDevice() {
    val dpm = context.getSystemService(DevicePolicyManager::class.java)
    dpm.lockNow()
}

Server-side logic (Python / Node.js):

When the user logs in or performs actions (based on IMEI/IP), the backend will determine whether the device should be locked/unlocked.


Example Backend Logic (Python):

from flask import Flask, request
import json

app = Flask(__name__)

devices = {
    "12345": {"status": "UNLOCK", "imei": "12345", "last_ip": "192.168.0.1"}
}

@app.route('/lock_device', methods=['POST'])
def lock_device():
    data = request.json
    imei = data.get('imei')
    if imei in devices:
        devices[imei]['status'] = "LOCK"
        return json.dumps({"status": "LOCKED"})
    return json.dumps({"status": "NOT_FOUND"})


@app.route('/unlock_device', methods=['POST'])
def unlock_device():
    data = request.json
    imei = data.get('imei')
    if imei in devices:
        devices[imei]['status'] = "UNLOCK"
        return json.dumps({"status": "UNLOCKED"})
    return json.dumps({"status": "NOT_FOUND"})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)


---

4. üß† Tamper Detection

To detect root access, debugging attempts, and OS modifications, implement checks to ensure the device hasn‚Äôt been compromised.

Automated Tamper Detection Code:

1. Root Check:



public class TamperDetection {

    public static boolean isDeviceRooted() {
        String[] paths = {"/sbin/su", "/system/bin/su", "/system/xbin/su"};
        for (String path : paths) {
            if (new File(path).exists()) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

2. Debugging Detection:



public boolean isDebuggerConnected() {
    return android.os.Debug.isDebuggerConnected();
}

Action: If root is detected or debugging is enabled, send an alert to the backend and potentially lock the device or wipe its data.

5. üåç Geo/IP/IMEI Binding for Device Tracking

For device location and identity binding, use IMEI and IP checks. Ensure that the device is traceable and does not move outside allowed regions.

Get IMEI (Android 10 and below):

public String getIMEI(Context context) {
    TelephonyManager tm = (TelephonyManager) context.getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);
    return tm.getImei();
}

Get IP Address:

public String getLocalIpAddress() {
    try {
        for (Enumeration<NetworkInterface> en = NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces(); en.hasMoreElements();) {
            NetworkInterface intf = en.nextElement();
            for (Enumeration<InetAddress> addrs = intf.getInetAddresses(); addrs.hasMoreElements();) {
                InetAddress addr = addrs.nextElement();
                if (!addr.isLoopbackAddress() && addr instanceof Inet4Address) {
                    return addr.getHostAddress();
                }
            }
        }
    } catch (SocketException ex) {
        Log.e("GeoTracking", "Error getting IP address", ex);
    }
    return null;
}

Send the IMEI and IP to your backend server, where you can compare it with stored values.

üîÑ Full System Flow

1. Onboarding:

User installs the app and grants device admin.

Device is registered with the backend, and the app fetches its IMEI, IP, and location.



2. Periodic Checks:

The app continuously checks the backend for lock/unlock commands.



3. Tamper Detection:

The app checks for rooting, debugging, and other signs of tampering.

If tampering is detected, the backend gets an alert, and appropriate action (lock, data wipe) is taken.



4. Geo/IP/IMEI Verification:

Device's identity (IMEI/IP) is regularly validated by the server.

If the device is in an unauthorized region or the IP changes, the server can trigger a lock.

‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations

1. User Consent: Ensure users know what data is being collected and how it will be used.


2. Transparency: Provide clear terms of service, privacy policies, and controls to the user.


3. Security: Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., IMEI, location) both at rest and in transit.

üöÄ Next Steps

1. Automate deployment: Set up CI/CD pipelines for quick app updates.


2. Scalable backend: Use cloud solutions like AWS, GCP, or Azure to manage device data securely.


3. Monitor and alert: Implement real-time logging and monitoring for abnormal behaviors.
