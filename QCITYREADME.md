## Setup

```

2. Configure environment variables:
Copy `config/.env.example` to `config/.env` and update the values.

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## API Endpoints

### Status
- `GET /api/qcity/status`: Get current system status

### Configuration
- `GET /api/qcity/config`: Get current configuration
- `POST /api/qcity/config`: Update configuration

### Control
- `POST /api/qcity/start`: Start Q-City
- `POST /api/qcity/stop`: Stop Q-City

## React Integration

Use the `useQCity` hook to integrate Q-City into your React components:

```typescript
import { useQCity } from '../hooks/useQCity';

function MyComponent() {
  const { status, config, start, stop } = useQCity();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Q-City Status: {status?.running ? 'Running' : 'Stopped'}</h1>
      <button onClick={start}>Start</button>
      <button onClick={stop}>Stop</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Configuration

Q-City can be configured through environment variables or the configuration API. Key configuration options include:

- Platform settings
- Feature flags
- Resource limits
- Security settings
- UI preferences
- Notification settings

## Security

Q-City implements several security features:
- Master access control
- Encryption
- Authentication
- Access control lists

## Monitoring

The system provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities:
- Resource usage tracking
- Performance metrics
- Error logging
- Activity logging

## Autonomous Vercel Deployment & Error Fixing

- The system now deploys to Vercel automatically, fixing errors and retrying as needed.
- If environment credentials are missing, it uses fallback defaults and still attempts deployment.
- All actions are logged and the master is notified of status and errors.
- No manual intervention is required for most deployment issues.
