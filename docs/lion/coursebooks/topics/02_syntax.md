# 2. Lion Syntax & Semantics

Lion uses simple line-oriented statements: `print:`, `run:`, `calc:` and more.

Subtopics:
- Keywords and line formats
- Strings, escaping and basic interpolation
- Extensibility points for adapters and plugins

Practical exercises: write small plans and run with `lion-runner.cjs`.
