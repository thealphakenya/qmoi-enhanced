1. Project Templates & Workspaces
- What: Projects with templates for chatbots, research, apps.
- Implementation: Workspace metadata, templates in Git, per-workspace storage.

2. Fine-grained Permissions
- What: Role-based access at workspace/file/function level.
- Implementation: RBAC, SSO integration, and audit logs.

3. Shared q.ki Memory Layers
- What: Workspace-level shared memory with opt-in sync.
- Implementation: Vector DB namespaces per workspace, access controls.

4. Live Collaboration (multi-user editing)
- What: CRDT-based collaborative editors for code and docs.
- Implementation: Yjs or Automerge with WebSocket server.

5. Avatar Rendering Pipeline
- What: Server-side avatar rendering for web and low-latency streaming.
- Implementation: GPU worker pool, containerized renderers, caching layer.

6. Voice & TTS Profiles
- What: Per-user voice profiles and TTS customization.
- Implementation: Store voice models as packages; use TTS service or edge runtime.

7. Task & Pipeline Orchestrator
- What: Visual pipeline builder and scheduler for data/model tasks.
- Implementation: DAG scheduler (Airflow/Prefect) with UI.

8. Shared Tool Integrations
- What: Configurable tools (search, DB, calculators) attached to workspaces.
- Implementation: Plugin registry and secure credential store.

9. Snapshot & Time Travel
- What: Workspace snapshots, restore points, and history view.
- Implementation: Periodic snapshots of workspace state and diffs.

10. Centralized Assets & Marketplace
- What: Shared assets (images, datasets) with permissions and licensing.
- Implementation: Blob store, metadata, and access controls.

11. Automated Runbooks & Playbooks
- What: Template runbooks for incidents and operations.
- Implementation: Structured playbooks triggered by alerts.

12. Code-to-Action Automation
- What: Convert notebook outputs to runnable jobs or endpoints.
- Implementation: Notebook parser + job runner.

13. In-workspace Model Training
- What: Light-weight in-workspace fine-tuning for small models.
- Implementation: Job queue, quota, and sandboxed runtime.

14. Audit & Compliance Reports
- What: Exportable reports for data lineage and access.
- Implementation: Logging and export tools.

15. Integrated Marketplace (workspace-level)
- What: Buy/sell workspace-specific models or assets.
- Implementation: Per-workspace billing and revenue split.

16. Offline-first Support
- What: Workspace caches for PWA clients and delta sync.
- Implementation: Service worker sync and conflict resolver.

17. Custom Widgets & Dashboards
- What: User-created widgets to visualize metrics and outputs.
- Implementation: Widget SDK and secure rendering sandbox.

18. Experimentation Tracker
- What: Track experiments, hyperparameters, and results.
- Implementation: Experiment DB, run metadata, and UI.

19. Alerts & Notifications
- What: Configurable alerts for runs, model drift, or usage spikes.
- Implementation: Notification service, channels (email, slack).

20. Policy Engine & Governance
- What: Workspace-level governance rules (data retention, export policies).
- Implementation: Policy configuration, enforcement hooks.

21. Resource Quotas & Billing
- What: Per-workspace compute/storage quotas and billing dashboards.
- Implementation: Metering and billing engine.

22. Built-in Labeling Workbench
- What: Workspace-integrated labeling for datasets.
- Implementation: Labeling UI, workforce integration.

23. Shared Agent Flows
- What: Multi-step agents that can act across workspace assets.
- Implementation: Agent runtime with scoped permissions.

24. Enterprise SSO & Provisioning
- What: SCIM provisioning and SSO onboarding for organizations.
- Implementation: SAML/OAuth/SCIM connectors.

25. Secure Secrets & Creds Store
- What: Workspace-level secrets with audit and rotation.
- Implementation: Integrate with HashiCorp Vault or K8s secrets.

Implementation notes
- Prioritize shared memory, offline-first, and RBAC early.
- Implement workspace-level namespaces for vector DB and blob storage.
- Ensure policies and auditability when adding monetization features.
