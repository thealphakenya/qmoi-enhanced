# Memory Validation ✅ PRODUCTION READY

Purpose

Validate QMOI memory subsystems (short-term cache, long-term store, snapshot/restore) and ensure data integrity, retention policies and recoverability.

Key checks

- Consistency: Ensure in-memory index and persisted store have matching IDs and checksums.
- Snapshot/restore: Periodically snapshot memory and attempt restore in a fresh environment as a smoke test.
- TTL and retention: Validate that short-term entries expire and that retention policies are enforced for long-term storage.
- Corruption detection: Use checksums/hashes to detect corruption and auto-alert/remediate.

Integration with orchestrator

- The orchestrator can run memory snapshot/restore tests in a controlled environment and produce `docs/memory_validation_report.json`.
