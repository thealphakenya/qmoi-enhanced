# QMOI Auto-Evolve, Auto-Enhance, Auto-Upgrade

## Overview
QMOI is a self-improving system that can automatically update, enhance, evolve, and upgrade itself across all features, files, and structures.

## Features
- Auto-update: Fetches and applies new updates automatically
- Auto-enhance: Optimizes performance, accessibility, and device support
- Auto-evolve: Learns from usage, adapts features, and restructures as needed
- Auto-upgrade: Seamlessly upgrades core, UI, integrations, and documentation
- Auto-fix: Detects and resolves errors, updates docs, and logs all changes

## How it Works
- QMOI monitors its own codebase, config, and docs
- When a new feature, device, or integration is detected, QMOI auto-generates stubs and docs
- Periodically checks for optimizations and applies them
- All changes are logged and can be reviewed or rolled back

## User Control
- Users can enable/disable auto-update/evolve in settings
- QMOI always asks for permission before major upgrades
